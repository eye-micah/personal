Black weeb in their early 20s. Gender is a fuck, I don't particularly care to label myself. Left-ish flexible politics. 

I love Linux.

I'm running:
 - [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on all of my laptops and desktops
 - [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) on my NAS, VPS, and any other servers or headless devices.

In a perpetual old hip-hop and R&B phase, but I'm open to listening to pretty much anything. I make a thing or two on the side.
