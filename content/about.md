Black weeb in their early 20s. Don't care too much about gender. Leftist. 

I love Linux.

I'm running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on everything, including the VPS that this site runs on.

In a perpetual old hip-hop and R&B phase, but I'm open to listening to pretty much anything. I make a thing or two on the side.
