## I have been known for not being the biggest fan of Umineko When They Cry.

A lot of VN culture's strongest soldiers, especially in the West, consider Umineko to be doujin author Ryukishi07's magnum opus. Coming from a shoestring budget and blowing up after the widespread success of Higurashi, this guy sat down and decided to completely revolutionize the mystery genre (or something). 

__Umineko is a bold and self-confident exploration of the way we engage with fiction and how we use it to address our own traumas, but I believe it does this irresponsibly.__

I think what would help y'all understand where I'm coming from is to "get" my taste in media. 

This is the kind of shit that gets me excited.

There's an undercurrent of anti-escapism and making the best out of a traumatic life or experiences. This relates to my own personal experiences, being mistreated physically and also falling prey *really fucking often* to depression and self-esteem challenges.

So, Umineko seems to fit me like a glove at first glance. What's the issue? Didn't I relate to Ange's own personal struggles and want to vicariously experience the same growth she did?

No, and I think Ryukishi07 makes a careless and honestly very frustrating mistake when writing the Answer arcs of Umineko: **it frames escapism as not just an indulgent short-term decision to stay sane, but a tool worth using long-term to avoid coming to terms with reality.**

This is what separates it even from Wonderful Everyday, a visual novel that consistently insinuates that our own perspectives are limited and restricted and reality is arguably malleable: Subahibi is insistent on you choosing to *confront* and *embrace* reality, while Umineko wants you to outright *side* with "magic", falsehoods and easy comforts in order to cope.

It's not as simple as *killing your past*, either, it's the opposite -- choosing to believe in a past that never actually happened for your own comfort.

I'm fine with flawed or imperfect characters in media, and I'd argue that I have a higher tolerance than most when it comes to forgiving and looking past their mistakes. I'm a huge advocate of rehabilitation and second chances. However, something about bashing your own family members' skulls in pleasure is irredeemable to me. Kyrie kinda just puts the entire experience of Umineko in a bad light to me -- why is Ange being encouraged to cherish her in any form? Same applies for Kinzo; this guy *raped* his own daughter and yet Ryukishi portrays him as a Silly Funny Guy in Episode 8 without ever considering how this could be fucked up. 

## Umineko struggles with treating heinous actions as such, but instead ignores them past a certain point and looks at you strange for feeling thrown off.
