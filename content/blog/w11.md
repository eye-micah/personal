Windows 11 sees a lot of ire and disdain from a vocal minority of users on the Internet. I mean, it does away with all the things that Made Windows Good like backward compatibility with old games they like, wishing away the tiny amount of customization you can do, and forcing users into [Secure Boot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-and-secure-boot-a8ff1202-c0d9-42f5-940f-843abef64fad). It seems like a step backward and not an improvement from 10, right?

## I really don't agree

Windows 11, to me, represents Microsoft's relatively small Windows division branching out and looking at what not only Apple has been doing, but the entire free and open-source desktop community. The improvements with virtual desktop support, improved UI consistency and design guidelines, and architectural changes are really nice.
