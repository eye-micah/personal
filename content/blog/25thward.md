Recently [finished](https://www.backloggd.com/u/zandyne_/review/1049609/) Suda51's sequel to Silver Case and Flower, Sun, and Rain, The 25th Ward. I think it does a lot right, but *holy shit* a full-time job really makes it hard to play Suda51 games, with all their tedium and narrative density. 

It kinda dawned on me why Kill the Past never really blew up like other long-running VN series, like Zero Escape, Danganronpa, Ace Attorney, and Science Adventure: it's just way too dense and disconnected from what mainstream VN readers want. And I think that's a shame. Kill the Past is one of the most thematically focused and socially conscious VN series, and feels diverse and cultured in a way these others lack. It's pulling from arthouse films, American blockbusters, and even constantly building on itself narratively. TSC morphs into FSR morphs into 25W. I think the very intentional thematic progression works better than the MCU/comic style "whoa look it's this glup shitto from this other franchise" thing that Science Adventure does, as an example.

There's no romance routes, no H-scenes, unconventional presentation with grating typewriter sounds going on in the background, The Silver Case and its sequel are fundamentally a different beast from the galge formula that even some of my favorite visual novels happen to follow.

I think a lot of VN readers just need that initial nudge that allows them to branch out.
