Nothing I'm saying here should be controversial.

I'm just baffled at how a lot of people have bought into the idea that cyberbullying is a simple thing people can just block out.

You need to understand that people cannot just ditch their social life online, especially if they [obtain validation](https://zandyne.xyz/blog/pipeline/) from it. Just like it's hard to break off a friend group that might treat you like shit in real life, because you don't really have any other options, it's also really hard to break away from a community you've joined and become comfortable with on Discord or something.

When you have some friends that you're totally cool with in the same space as their friends that make you want to die, you're kinda limited in options. You could maybe form a space without the people that make you uncomfortable, but that's a great way to start drama. 

Maybe you start a group DM, but then someone decides to leak screenshots of you talking shit about the people you don't like. Maybe it's moving to a different platform altogether -- from Discord to Telegram or Twitter circles or some shit. I don't know, my point is it's not always very easy to just up and move and place yourself in a comfortable space where you STILL have some level of online socialization.

And, no, I'm not saying that online communities are a replacement for offline frined groups. What I am saying is that a lot of people have a real desire for both, and feeling somewhat comfortable in both spaces is crucial to mental health. Disregarding this because online interactions "aren't real" or something is a really limited view of the situation. Platforms like Discord allow for some level of anonymity, letting a lot of people comfortably interact with friends around them without feeling like they need to present a certain way. Voice training doesn't matter on Discord unless you open voice chat, and no one's going to judge whether you "pass" or not.

When people are blamed for taking drastic actions -- like self-harm or worse -- from cyberbullying, it's not something we should downplay as being as simple as "turn off the computer". Honestly, a lot of the time, that makes things worse as an entire angle of socialization may now have disappeared for someone.

If you go to a Christian school or a heavily Christian workplace and come home to Christian family or friends, knowing damn well that they wouldn't approve of you being gay, what space do you have but the Discordserver you have with friends that lets you shoot the shit and say what's on your mind? Would you really give up that space because one or two people push your buttons?
