2023 was a great year for me in terms of branching out and experiencing new stuff. Here's some notable works that left a big impact on me this year. Not everything here is a perfect 10 or even something I particularly like.

**Inland Empire (2006)**

I've been reluctant to really finish this movie because it's like 3 hours and I was told the experience is unnerving in general. However, I've eaten through most of David Lynch's discography and this was like the only thing left. Inland Empire explores the relationship movies have with reality and the way the gap between the two can slowly be broken and the line can be blurred. Without spoiling, I think it's an excellent evolution of the surrealist direction and theme that Mulholland Drive was attempting. I do not recommend this as your first Lynch flick, it should be like your fifth.

**Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name (2023)**

Already talked about this on my [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/zandyne_/review/1139880/) but Gaiden is a really enjoyable love letter that shows how good RGG Studio has gotten at the Yakuza formula. It's a love letter to the series as a whole, and ties everything up in a really satisfying conclusion. The final boss is top 5 in the series, easy.

**Drakengard (2003)**

Taro at his prime. Postmodern commentary on the increasing indulgence of violence in mainstream video games back in the 2000s, and while a lot of that critique seems silly nowadays, the experience as a whole is so surreal and feels straight out of Eva or Berserk at points. You should experience this.

**Digital Devil Saga duology (2004-2005)**

Atlus R&D's crown jewel, written and designed at their absolute prime as a studio, putting out the best content they ever have. Digital Devil Saga is heavy-handed and very straightforward in its theming, but Atlus has never been known for their subtlety. DDS manages to tie Hindu mythology into an interesting science-fiction framework exploring the worth of AI and breaking the cycle of violence all too common in humanity. 

The Press Turn system from Nocturne evolves here and provides some of the most satisfying turn-based combat, ever. Kazuma Kaneko pumped out some of the most interesting designs he ever has with the uniquely stylized Atma forms of the cast.

**Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou (1998)**

Kare Kano's anime adaptation is peak Hideaki Anno, taking advantage of all the directorial tricks he grew accustomed to in past works like Evangelion and Nadia. I don't think the anime "falls off" at all, and instead feel it maintains a pretty consistent level of quality. I think this is a great example of a solid director elevating the experience of source material. I've since then read the manga and it doesn't hit nearly as hard for me as it does with that Gainax touch. No disrespect to Masami Tsuda, though.

**Rule of Rose (2006)**

Unique in its child cast and grim tone and subject matter. Gameplay made me want to blow my brains out, but I understand why this game's so cherished.

**Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (2023)**

Outside of some balancing issues, this is one of the most satisfying games released this year and addresses the itch I've had in my brain for years wanting more Armored Core.

**Oyasumi Punpun (2007)**

Not the kind of thing I would normally experience in manga form, but I'm glad I did. Punpun is incredibly thoughtful and intelligent in its understanding of social dynamics, abuse, trauma, and coming of age. Don't read this unless you specifically are open to getting kicked in the nuts emotionally.

**Scott Pilgrim (2004)**

Okay, this is a reread, but I don't care. Revisiting this has been absolutely great, as I'm able to relate to the subject matter here way more than I did as a kid. O'Malley's Nerd References and Video Game Callbacks might seem corny in current year, but it feels a lot more genuine when you consider the time period it was written in. The entire experience feels very genuine and explores two flawed people trying to mend together a relationship. I love it.
