So, one of my biggest gripes with a lot of people online lately is the way they'll approach some niche otaku-focused franchise or piece of media and stand from a distance in ironic disgust and contempt. It's almost always a matter of getting upset that the piece of media with a clear appeal and target audience stands behind that target audience. 

# Okay, but

## It's morally wrong to like this!!
Do we even need to unpack the rabbit hole of unethical consumption in mainstream media? You know Oda? The guy behind One Piece? Yeah. That guy stood behind a dude with gigabytes of Cheese Pizza. 

I have nothing against people that are into One Piece. It's a fun show, and that fanbase is generally incredibly pleasant. But some of you are sitting in glass houses.

I think what really irks me is the fundamental contradictions in this mindset. It's one thing to take a stand against behavior you think is immoral or unethical. Sure, that's totally fine. *My* gripe is when some of you niggas rep a series like Melty Blood and simultaneously distance yourselves from its source material, or become hardcore anti-lolicon Ryukishi07 fans. If you actually equate some of this behavior and content to real life content, then it should *seriously* disgust you to pick up a series like Higurashi or Berserk and just shamelessly promote it everywhere.

## It promotes bad behavior!!
This is an empty statement. Pretty much any piece of transgressive media, anything with a theme or a message or some kind of evocative content in it, will influence someone's behavior, and it may be in a catastrophic way. A Drakengard 3 fan could want to kill themselves after struggling through a 10fps video game!  How many people are running out to fuck their stepsister because Shiki Tohno decided to do it in Tsukihime? Your average person has enough common sense to understand when an event in a story isn't something they should live out. [Fiction *does* influence reality](../inland-empire-and-the-mirror-of-fiction), but there's a touch more nuance than literal 90s fearmongering about gamers groomed into becoming the next Sandy Hook shooter.

## It makes me uncomfortable!!
Plenty of shit makes me uncomfortable too, man. I'm not saying you have to tolerate every genre or niche or piece of media, I'm just telling you to stay the fuck away from it and not try and drag fans online for clout. It's irritating and unenjoyable to see the latest screed of a 15 year old show or game or something with people complaining it doesn't meet their modern standards and personal politics. Not everything is for you, and as long as uncomfortable and problematic media is properly labelled and has necessary warnings behind it, there shouldn't be any issue in you simply walking away and avoiding it.


I think some kinds of content is just gross or vile or disgusting, to the point where it really shouldn't be openly shared around. But, **how constructive is it to go online and "ratio" some random guy on Twitter for likes?**
