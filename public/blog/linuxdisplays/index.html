<h1>Linux display headaches - Why I&#x27;m stuck on Wayland</h1>



<p>My Linux history has a long association with Nvidia. Not out of choice, but just because at the time I didn't really know Nvidia had some issues on the platform. I needed a low profile GPU for the low end OEM PC I owned at the time, and popping in a GT 1030 seemed like the right choice. At the time, I was daily driving Windows anyway, and never had to even <em>think</em> about whether or not my displays would work, hardware acceleration would work, etc.</p>
<p>Switched to Linux, and on the surface things seemed to be smooth, but then the issues hit. Keep in mind this was around 2018-2019.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware acceleration didn't work, PERIOD. Outside of mpv/VLC.</li>
<li>That specific card doesn't support NVENC, which isn't necessarily an Nvidia driver problem, but it's frustrating how they ship out cards without such a useful feature.</li>
<li>Kernel updates would frequently break shit. Some days I'd be greeted with a black screen, or Plymouth would be squashed or replaced with an ugly fallback visual.</li>
<li>VKD3D (DirectX12 to Vulkan translation layer) experiences MAJOR peformance hits on Pascal or older cards. Also not technically something Nvidia can do anything about, but still a headache.</li>
<li>Multiple displays with different refresh rates, VRR, and fractional scaling never worked.</li>
<li>The desktop in general was noticeably choppier than Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also had headaches with Nvidia Optimus on older Thinkpads. Jesus Christ, I never want to return to that again. </p>
<p>All of these pain points, some of which self-imposed for using old hardware, have permanently burned me and made me reluctant to use Nvidia on Linux hardware. Despite this, I still use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PNY-NVIDIA-Quadro-Professional-Graphics/dp/B06X9PW5DZ">low profile Quadro</a> in my NAS/media server. Nvidia's nice for that use case, since they offer very power efficient cards with solid encoders. Even then, I'm considering whether or not I should just replace that thing with a Radeon.</p>
<p>AMD GPUs have a mountain of issues, like their lack of focus on compute and non-gaming workloads, but almost every issue I run into on AMD I've found workarounds for. I use DaVinci Resolve and it works fine on AMD nowadays with OpenCL, OBS streaming and recording works fine, and whenever I get bored and decide to work with Stable Diffusion that also works fine. I'm not moving away from their offerings anytime soon, and I just hope they take some of their issues more seriously.</p>
<p>I bought a 6600 XT months ago and it's been an almost seamless experience. The only problems with the GPU are actual documented problems with the specific model I have, like not working in the PCIe x16 slot properly without lowering it in BIOS to x8 speeds, and the occasional crash in two specific games (<a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2058180">Judgment</a> and <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2058190">Lost Judgment</a>). I also have a Steam Deck which has given me an issue-free gaming experience on the same GPU architecture (RDNA2). Life is good.</p>
<p>There's nuance to the GPU conundrum on Linux, and I'm not trying to present AMD as the no-brainer option in all cases, but I <em>cannot</em> emphasize enough how it works so much better for me.</p>
<p>M.</p>
