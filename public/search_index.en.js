But yeah, I'm black. And I'm slowly coming around to accepting that.\nYou see, as a kid, I was raised in pretty white areas at school that weren't overtly and obviously racist, but more subtly and uncomfortably bigoted at points. The occasional comment about how my nose is too big, my skin is too dark to look nice, how \"people like me don't speak English\", it goes on and on. Whatever. My point is, not the best kind of environment for a black boy in America.\nI was homeschooled for a year in my life and became incredibly unashamed at expressing my thoughts and being generally friendly to the people around me. When I got looked at like I was crazy after re-entering real school (because homeschooled kids lack social cues most of the time), I quickly wanted nothing more than to fit in with the other kids.\nThings got so bad when I was really young that my self-image was that of a white kid. Tried to get my name legally changed to whatever corny ass white names I could think of at the time, and grew angry at my hair not following the same pattern as the kids around me. I wanted to fit in, but obviously that didn't really work out.\nNow, I've lived a pretty comfortable lower-middle class life. Parents are together and have a healthy relationship, sisters both have their quirks but enjoy my presence, and I've got about 6 certificates, a nice-looking resumé, and a couple credits working towards my bachelor's. But I think this was my downfall, at the same time. You see, I lacked the upbringing of even a lot of my Black peers in high school. They had to worry about whether or not the water would be running at home, I was concerned with dumb shit like my Gentoo installation at home breaking. And this kinda pulled me into the alt-right later on in life.\n...More on that later.\nAnyway, something clicked towards the end of high school, going into college, where I realized that a lot of my dysphoric feelings were because of:\nA. the fact that the gender binary didn't really work for me.\nB. I'm black, and not white.\nSo my twenties are gonna be a needed reclaiming of my own culture. That's probably the reason behind my excessive use of nigga :)\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/blackculture/","title":"My disconnect from Black culture -- and how I reclaimed it"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/cyberbullying/":{"body":"Nothing I'm saying here should be controversial.\nI'm just baffled at how a lot of people have bought into the idea that cyberbullying is a simple thing people can just block out.\nYou need to understand that people cannot just ditch their social life online, especially if they obtain validation from it. Just like it's hard to break off a friend group that might treat you like shit in real life, because you don't really have any other options, it's also really hard to break away from a community you've joined and become comfortable with on Discord or something.\nWhen you have some friends that you're totally cool with in the same space as their friends that make you want to die, you're kinda limited in options. You could maybe form a space without the people that make you uncomfortable, but that's a great way to start drama. \nMaybe you start a group DM, but then someone decides to leak screenshots of you talking shit about the people you don't like. Maybe it's moving to a different platform altogether -- from Discord to Telegram or Twitter circles or some shit. I don't know, my point is it's not always very easy to just up and move and place yourself in a comfortable space where you STILL have some level of online socialization.\nAnd, no, I'm not saying that online communities are a replacement for offline frined groups. What I am saying is that a lot of people have a real desire for both, and feeling somewhat comfortable in both spaces is crucial to mental health. Disregarding this because online interactions \"aren't real\" or something is a really limited view of the situation. Platforms like Discord allow for some level of anonymity, letting a lot of people comfortably interact with friends around them without feeling like they need to present a certain way. Voice training doesn't matter on Discord unless you open voice chat, and no one's going to judge whether you \"pass\" or not.\nWhen people are blamed for taking drastic actions -- like self-harm or worse -- from cyberbullying, it's not something we should downplay as being as simple as \"turn off the computer\". Honestly, a lot of the time, that makes things worse as an entire angle of socialization may now have disappeared for someone.\nIf you go to a Christian school or a heavily Christian workplace and come home to Christian family or friends, knowing damn well that they wouldn't approve of you being gay, what space do you have but the Discord server you have with friends that lets you shoot the shit and say what's on your mind? Would you really give up that space because one or two people push your buttons?\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/cyberbullying/","title":"Cyberbullying sucks, actually"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/fossapps/":{"body":"Too much modern software is designed to fuck you in the ass.\nAnd so many people put up with it. This isn't me looking down on people from my ivory tower, I'm forced to use some of it too. BUT there's a way out sometimes.\nFree and open-source software is software where you can see all of the ingredients all laid out for you -- the code is easily accessible and available to anyone and instead of it being exclusive to a big company, it's something anyone can contribute to. The best open source projects are massive collaborative efforts like the Linux kernel, Android, a large chunk of the modern web, etc. \nAnd desktop apps are no different. Turns out there's a lot of alternatives to paywall-ridden, subscription-based software that barely works and nags you about expiring trial periods. \nI'm going to just name applications I actually like that I make use of, and divide them by groups.\nVideo editing\nUnfortuantely, I haven't been able to completely abandon commercial video editors. I need to use DaVinci Resolve for large, potentially collaborative projects (still a great editor, btw). Outside of that, I've been able to move any fun personal projects and the vast majority of my video editing to open source alternatives.\nOlive is an up and coming editor that's pretty smooth and performant, but is still in active development and is currently technically an alpha release. Despite this, I've happily done tons of stuff with this editor, including complex keyframed visuals. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to just have a smooth, modern editor.\nKdenlive and the technologies and frameworks that it's made out of have been around for a while. If you like Sony Vegas-like UI, it might be the right option for you. The issue with Kdenlive is it lags behind in terms of GPU acceleration, so if you have a beefy GPU, that shit's going to be almost completely dormant using this. Pretty solid tried and true option.\nDrawing and painting\nGIMP has quite a learning curve and pales in comparison in terms of functionality to Photoshop, but I've done a ton of image editing and visuals with it. \nKrita is a great painting software that has nice, intuitive UI. Haven't found anything that quite matches what it can do in terms of functionality. \nInkscape is a vector image editing tool, and while it has a bit of a learning curve too, I've found it to be just as powerful as the alternatives like Adobe Illustrator. I really like this one.\nWeb browsers\nIn my personal opinion, there's very little reason to actively use a browser that isn't open-source. If you're like me, you're inputting a ton of personal information into these things, and personally I'd rather have something I use so extensively vetted by a community, with its vulnerabilities and functionality laid bare. \nYou don't have to look far:\nFirefox has been around for a while, and it's also been really fucking fast for a while. Uses less RAM than Chrome and friends, and is a little more respectful to your privacy. There's also a lot of customization you can do to the way it looks, if that's your thing.\nThe thing about most modern web browsers is they share an engine with Chrome, the Blink engine. It's kind of concerning how the entire modern web just revolves around this one technology and if some vulnerability appears, everything suffers. Electron apps like Discord, Slack, and Spotify that are running in mini web-browsers also use Blink. \nFirefox stands as the one big non-Chrome browser you can use nowadays, so outside of just having a lot of practical benefits you can feel good inside knowing you're fighting against Google's monopoly or something. I dunno, probably won't do much. Fuck Google.\nHowever, if you really want to use a Chromium-based browser, I recommend Brave. It's got the kitchen sink with it out of the box: adblocking, a BitTorrent client, and weird crypto shit that you can disable, thankfully. \nKDE Connect\nIf you have an Android and a Windows or Linux computer, you're probably missing out on one of the most useful tools I've run into recently: KDE Connect. Being able to view battery life, get notifs on my PCs, reply to SMS messages from my PC, ring my phone, control music playback, and share files seamlessly has made my life a lot easier. You can get a Mac &amp; iPhone-like integration without buying overpriced metal slabs :)\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it kinda drives me insane seeing people settle for crappy commercial software when sometimes there are perfectly good alternatives they could switch to with way less issues. Give some of them a look.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/fossapps/","title":"FOSS apps you should be using"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/linuxdesktop/":{"body":"In my opinion, Linux desktops leverage technologies that aren't sustainable if it's going to see widespread use on modern computers and be issued out as a preinstalled product on them. I'm going to bring up examples of several other modern operating systems used on the desktop to show that there is a better, more robust design model that makes sense for \"normies\".\nSeparation between system and user\nThis is very obviously a point influenced by macOS, but it still reigns true. There's no Linux System to target on the desktop, or at least there isn't with the traditional distribution model. Two people's Ubuntu installations can vary wildly differently, and there's no consistent \"system\" it an rely on and deploy on modern computers. \nDell offers XPS laptops shipped with Ubuntu, and other vendors have shipped out Ubuntu, Fedora, and even Manjaro on their laptops. But here's the question: how do you do tech support and help troubleshoot issues on their laptops when they're all heavily customized with tons of packages straying from the default? What do you even deploy to these laptops and desktop systems besides some custom-built Dell XPS Ubuntu ISO that they have to maintain on their own terms?\nHaving a system (volume) also allows you to sign all binaries part of that system. Since macOS 11, Apple has deployed signed system volumes that limits access to files on the system and refuses to allow binaries without a valid cryptographic signature. \nOutside of the obvious security benefits of this approach, it offers the ability to keep past OS installations as volumes, which can have their own snapshots used with Time Machine (Mac's user-facing OS backup app).\nWindows\nUh, Windows is a mess and while there's some level of separation involved where your average program will not bring the entire computer down, there's not really a guarantee. Tons of Windows installations have gross registry hacks or tweaks or whatever and there's not really much consistency between installations, either. Most vendors ship out their own custom images of Windows, and you can do it somewhat easily with DISM, but it's ultimately a hack over a really janky system. It's still slightly better than the complete lack of separation we have on Linux:\nCan't we do this in Linux?\nLinux has some of this tech already, and has for a while. \nFedora Silverblue offers image-based updates that issue out system updates through Git-like library management called ostree. This model is the closest we've gotten to some kind of \"system\" on a desktop Linux system. You have your desktop environment, basic applications like a terminal or a text editor, graphics drivers, kernel, etc. all as one easily reproducible system, rather than being a mishmash of different packages pull from repositories. This is great. \nYou can't write to Silverblue's filesystem, outside of /etc, which it keeps track of file changes with, and some other directories like /var/home (which is used as the /home directory) and /tmp. This makes it not only newcomer proof but a reliable solution for even experienced Linux users that aren't interested in babysitting their distro. It makes everything easier to troubleshoot and fix for distro maintainers.\nThe logic with Silverblue and similar systems is using Flatpak, a sandboxed and containerized application format, for installing most software. This keeps the base system neat, tidy, and isolated while package maintainers can deploy their own applications, and there's no risk of the two interfering or causing package conflicts. It also makes it way easier to debug problems with both.\nThere is a project called Universal Blue, which already takes advantage of the technologies behind Silverblue to offer various customized images for different use cases. As you can see, there's still plenty of customization potential here, but it's now done declaratively, before you install your system and not afterwards. \nBoth ostree and flatpak still have deduplication, so there aren't as many duplicate libraries hogging up space as you might expect. \nChromeOS\nChromebooks, if you didn't know, utilize this same image-based update system. The difference is compared to a Mac or a normal immutable Linux distro, CBs are very much so locked down and sandboxed from the top down. The expectation is you're never really interacting with the system's innards, because most work done on a Chromebook is using web applications and software and files in the cloud. However, notice how it's not particularly difficult to support a Chromebook and solve software issues -- you can always \"powerwash\" and reset the device to its initial state and have a robust, reliable system there.\nSteamOS 3\nThe Steam Deck is probably the best example of \"traditional\" Desktop Linux utilizing an immutable filesystem. You can tinker to your heart's content on Deck, mucking around with mods and installing all sorts of weird games, without ever being concerned that the machine won't boot tomorrow morning. Valve deploys ChromeOS-style updates and can ship them out without walking its users through the process of pacman -Syu and reading the Arch Linux news every time they want to update their computer. Most gamers will be fine with the offerings of Flatpaks available on Deck, and may not even know what a Flatpak is, just that Chrome and an Epic Games launcher and Dolphin Emulator are right there and easy to download.\nThe reality is that no end user should ever have to interface directly with a package manager. They shouldn't even know what that is.\nWhat the hell do I mean by this? Think about it this way -- People that use their computers as tools rather than wanting to understand how everything really works just want to be able to access the apps they need. They want Excel or Word or Zoom or Chrome or whatever, and the details in terms of how it's obtained do not really matter.\nIf you tell a newcomer to run sudo apt install X because it's more reliable than using a GUI tool, you've already lost the plot.\nPackage managers should not be a user-facing tool, and their functions should be abstracted by \"app stores\" and \"system updates\". If you're a developer or someone that relies on a package manager, then you can easily fire up a container of some sort and go nuts. But Grandma does not need to know what's happening behind the scenes.\nRemember Linus Sebastian tried to install Steam on Pop!_OS and when he couldn't get a basic app used for gaming working, he jumped to the terminal as per System76's recommendations ON THEIR SITE?\nPop, a distribution based on Debian, ended up with a package conflict between Steam and core system packages like the literal desktop environment and systemd. Not going to attack the distro maintainers, stuff happens, but HOW THE HELL IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN on a system marketed towards desktop users?\nThe traditional model for application distribution on Linux is just too brittle, and not particularly robust, reproducible, or safe. \nAnd I think the issue is, a large amount of Linux users are incredibly stubborn in keeping the operating system this way.\nThere are so many oldheads that will defend to the death the ability to literally remove your boot loader and kernel because you installed the wrong version of Chrome. To them, taking inspiration from other operating systems is the death of what they deem a better approach to computer usage.\nI get it. Macs, Windows machines, phones, everything presents proprietary walled gardens designed to fuck over its users at points. There's a certain level of reluctance here. But we're not going to get anywhere if we don't acknowledge the faults of desktop Linux.\nThe driver situation\nFundamentally, Linux has an issue with the way out-of-tree drivers are approached; while trying to integrate everything directly into the kernel and not having a stable ABI for them speeds up development and might make things immediately easier for kernel development, it's an utterly impractical and unsustainable way to deal with the reality of the way drivers are managed. \nDKMS is clunky and forces modules to be recompiled every time they're used, and no out of tree drivers like ZFS, Nvidia, Broadcom, etc. integrate well when you need to do that every time. The reality is that a TON of people have older peripherals or just peripherals or devices that might have spotty Linux support or only target old versions of the kernel, and there's no way to seamlessly have them integrate with a simple driver download in the same vein as Windows.\nmacOS isn't really that much better, as they've entirely ditched kernel extensions in favor of system extensions or whatever, which run in userspace. I think Windows is kinda unbeat in this way as you can pretty much get any device or driver working regardless of age. \nWhat can we do?\nWell, the driver situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon, it's just a fundamental flaw for desktop usage for things to be arranged that way. One way to patch the flaws up here is to just keep integrating more and more drivers into the Linux kernel, so there's no need to even bother with hacky solutions trying to integrate them. \nAdditionally, a robust image-based system can also ship with needed kernel modules, including out of tree ones, making for a more appealing proposition for hardware vendors to ship their custom-built version of a Linux distro. I can absolutely see a world where Dell ships out their own immutable distro with certain preinstalled tweaks or packages.\nAll of this comes from love and appreciation of Linux. I still daily drive it for large amounts of my day, and do ALL of my gaming and most programming, development, automation, machine learning, and a bunch of other stuff on a Linux desktop. I'm just tired of these long-standing issues and would like more people to embrace the future.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/linuxdesktop/","title":"How do we 'fix' the Linux desktop?"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/linuxdisplays/":{"body":"My Linux history has a long association with Nvidia. Not out of choice, but just because at the time I didn't really know Nvidia had some issues on the platform. I needed a low profile GPU for the low end OEM PC I owned at the time, and popping in a GT 1030 seemed like the right choice. At the time, I was daily driving Windows anyway, and never had to even think about whether or not my displays would work, hardware acceleration would work, etc.\nSwitched to Linux, and on the surface things seemed to be smooth, but then the issues hit. Keep in mind this was around 2018-2019.\n\nHardware acceleration didn't work, PERIOD. Outside of mpv/VLC.\nThat specific card doesn't support NVENC, which isn't necessarily an Nvidia driver problem, but it's frustrating how they ship out cards without such a useful feature.\nKernel updates would frequently break shit. Some days I'd be greeted with a black screen, or Plymouth would be squashed or replaced with an ugly fallback visual.\nVKD3D (DirectX12 to Vulkan translation layer) experiences MAJOR peformance hits on Pascal or older cards. Also not technically something Nvidia can do anything about, but still a headache.\nMultiple displays with different refresh rates, VRR, and fractional scaling never worked.\nThe desktop in general was noticeably choppier than Windows.\n\nI've also had headaches with Nvidia Optimus on older Thinkpads. Jesus Christ, I never want to return to that again. \nAll of these pain points, some of which self-imposed for using old hardware, have permanently burned me and made me reluctant to use Nvidia on Linux hardware. Despite this, I still use a low profile Quadro in my NAS/media server. Nvidia's nice for that use case, since they offer very power efficient cards with solid encoders. Even then, I'm considering whether or not I should just replace that thing with a Radeon.\nAMD GPUs have a mountain of issues, like their lack of focus on compute and non-gaming workloads, but almost every issue I run into on AMD I've found workarounds for. I use DaVinci Resolve and it works fine on AMD nowadays with OpenCL, OBS streaming and recording works fine, and whenever I get bored and decide to work with Stable Diffusion that also works fine. I'm not moving away from their offerings anytime soon, and I just hope they take some of their issues more seriously.\nI bought a 6600 XT months ago and it's been an almost seamless experience. The only problems with the GPU are actual documented problems with the specific model I have, like not working in the PCIe x16 slot properly without lowering it in BIOS to x8 speeds, and the occasional crash in two specific games (Judgment and Lost Judgment). I also have a Steam Deck which has given me an issue-free gaming experience on the same GPU architecture (RDNA2). Life is good.\nThere's nuance to the GPU conundrum on Linux, and I'm not trying to present AMD as the no-brainer option in all cases, but I cannot emphasize enough how it works so much better for me.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/linuxdisplays/","title":"Linux display headaches - Why I'm stuck on Wayland"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/macos/":{"body":"So I've recently ended up using a lot of Macs due to work. Not just MacBooks, but iMacs. They range from current gen M1s and M2s to ancient 2012 MacBooks. \nAnd... I have to say, I quite like the experience.\nDon't get me wrong, in terms of usability and functionality, I think Linux is leagues ahead. But GOD this is a way more usable experience than Windows, to the point where I'm seriously considering giving it a shot as a dual boot via GPU passthrough on my Linux PC.\nI'll get into my issues with Windows later, but right now, I just want to highlight a lot of the things I like about Macs, on both the hardware and software front.\nHardware\nMacs all have a nice aluminum finish to them that makes them feel very premium and high-profile. The metal finish doesn't inspire confidence that I'd be able to drop it from a flight of stairs though, but that's most laptops that aren't old ThinkPads or rugged military laptops. \nThe keyboards nowadays are quite good. They're, again, not as good as a ThinkPad keyboard, and lack the incredibly useful trackpoint, but there are so many other advantages that it doesn't really matter to me. I personally prefer keyboards with a bit more travel, but at minimum it's a huge improvement from the weird feel and travel of the older Intel MacBooks in that weird phase.\nApple Silicon is a really hard truth to accept, as someone that cares quite a bit about repairability and openness in hardware. There's no real way to upgrade storage or RAM on Apple Silicon SoCs. This means once your M1 Mac becomes old and obsolete, there's not much you can do if you didn't spend the premium on more RAM and storage. The trade off, of course, is improved speed, but I'm not sure if it's a worthy sacrifice.\nThe battery life and performance is absolutely absurd on these machines nowadays, so while it feels disgusting and sinful to me, the usability of these laptops ramps up incredibly well. At home, I have a bulky full ATX tower eating up space and making noise in my room. It's not the loudest thing ever. It's got a Noctua air cooler and Arctic PST PWM cast fans (which are a bit annoying). But, M1/M2 Macs are silent. I can go to bed and not hear a single thing, and that's nice. They can fit into a smaller form factor and be passively cooled, which makes me dream of the day I can rest a mini-sized PC on my desk with performance on par with my current gaming PC.\nSoftware\nI think there are some things that are incredibly well thought-out about macOS. One of the things I actually really love is the difference in approach to keyboard shortcuts. On Windows and Linux, you have to memorize a bunch of unintuitive keyboard shortcuts revolving around the Super/Meta/Windows key. They're not consistent or intuitive, in my opinion. The other day, in fact, I was working on a Windows machine when it prompted me to input CTRL+ALT+Delete in order to change the soon-to-expire password as per organization group policy. Kinda had to take a step back and realize \"what the hell?\"\nOne of the things I love is how reliable the ⌘C and ⌘V shortcuts are on Mac. Makes copy-pasting into terminals a dream, since you no longer have to awkwardly hit Shift+Ctrl+C or Shift+Ctrl+V to interact with content on the terminal. It's the little things that count.\nmacOS has had large chunks of its filesystem read-only since Catalina, and that's also a really good choice, in my opinion. I'm a huge fan of immutable operating systems and think they offer benefits to stability and possibly even security. Apple issues out image-based updates in the same vein as iOS, Android, Chrome OS, and most immutable Linux distros, and I think this is the right call rather than the clunky experience that Windows and mutable Linux distros offer a lot of the time.\n\n    \n    \n\nThere's no reason this should ever happen.\nSoftware installation (that's not done through the App Store itself) is as dead simple as dragging and dropping an application folder to the /Applications folder. Most installers will prompt you for this automatically. It's really straightforward and is a punch above the garbage .MSI installers on Windows. Unfortunately, not having a well-integrated first-party package manager sucks and makes installing a lot of software not as seamless as Linux.\nBrew works fine until you realize a huge chunk of software needs to be compiled. It's kind of like FreeBSD ports or the AUR where a lot of stuff is available but it all needs to be compiled. Updates and installation can take forever. \nBut most large, mainstream desktop apps are a simple as mounting a .DMG file and dragging/dropping.\nThe window management is quite good in some areas, but lacking in others. The virtual desktop management is really solid, with a focus on neatly organizing full-screen apps. A three-finger swipe up on the trackpad gives me easy access to all of my desktops and windows, and a swipe to the left or right seamlessly switches them. Ctrl + arrow keys has the same behavior.\nUnfortunately, the window tiling features are so behind everything else it's pathetic. It's such a pain getting windows to tile properly, as you have to press and hold the maximize button to even do it. I don't understand why this feature is so hard to access and why it's so limited. You can install extensions to make this experience a little better, but it's really embarrassing how insulated Apple can be at times.\nMusic production and any audio stuff has been incredibly solid on a Mac. I don't really have any complaints, but I've found that I rarely run into compatibility issues with audio on any of the three operating systems I use for it. My MIDI controllers like my drum pad and keyboard work fine, but they work fine on everything. \nVideo editing has been fine, too. The experience is better than Linux in that regard as DaVinci Resolve is more stable and performant on AMD there. I've used it on my Hackintosh VM without any issues.\nAnother big thing is how gorgeous the entire operating system looks. There's a level of visual consistency that's just completely absent of Windows, and that Linux is only just now working towards. One of my biggest issues with Windows in general is how ugly and incoherent everything looks as a whole. Every application does its own thing, and even built-in stuff can range from Windows 3.1 to XP to 10 to 11 in terms of UI style. It really irks me.\nThe lack of any kind of gaming support is kind of preventing me from even considering trying this thing full-time. I do 100% of my gaming on Linux nowadays, between my PCs and my Steam Deck. I just game on the host system nowadays and it works fine, though.\nWhat's my beef with Windows, and why have I somewhat come around to Apple recently?\nWindows, to me, represents the stuffy, old Oxford button-down shirt approach to desktop use. It's not necessarily more efficient, it's just familiar, and so bogged down in its familiarity that it brings everything else down with it. So many Linux distros aim to emulate Windows and all of its frustrating quirks, and they have a lot of the same usability issues as a result. There's an insane focus on backwards compatibility and clinging to the old and familiar, and a lot of Windows use in general seems skewed towards old design conventions and legacy software. It feels old, and not in a good and comfy way. \nIt's far from being unusable, especially with Windows Subsystem for Linux and the wide berth of software support. Don't get me wrong. I just really, really dislike using it nowadays. It feels unpolished. macOS, for better or worse, makes a lot of choices that distinguish it from Windows, and it's not as much of a Swiss-army knife as Windows is as a result. It's not your best option for video games, or CAD software, or a long list of other use cases. \nApple sucks\nI don't love or even like Apple as a company. They provide proprietary, walled-garden products and entrap you in their ecosystem, without offering the flexibility that one might want integrating their products with non-Apple stuff. Good luck having solid integration between a Mac and an Android, or an iPhone and Linux. \nThey charge extravagant prices for their hardware and have a spotty track record that's only now kind of bouncing back to where it was.\nDespite this, I think macOS has become a pretty usable product for personal desktop use. If you need some specific legacy software, sure, go ahead and use Windows. If you need Samba shares, USE WINDOWS, PLEASE. If you need a more integrated development environment, or if you don't want to lose out on flexibility, feel free to use desktop Linux. But honestly, for the most part, this shit \"just works.\"\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/macos/","title":"Why I kinda like Macs"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/pipeline/":{"body":"Teenagers like validation.\nYou don't need me to tell you this. Pretty much any kid from the age of like 13 all the way to... honestly, their early 20s can be absolutely obsessed with social validation. Puberty hits and kids are funneled into conformity at schools that demand they set aside a block of their day towards the same shit over and over again. \nWhen kids are thrown into school, they simultaneously want to fit in and stand out.\nIf they're forced to whip out an iron every day and throw on a stuffy uniform, they'll wear shoes that slightly push the limits of the dress code. Fuck it, I might be forced to wear a polo and khakis every day but I'm still gonna throw on my Yeezys. At the same time, if someone talks shit about them, they might just show up with a different pair of sneakers just to feel acknowledged.\nThis is just a normal part of being a teenager. \nSame thing applies to politics at that age.\nThe vast majority of middle-class teens in America aren't really endowed with years of experience working and engaging with the real world. When there are really no consequences to strong opinions you pick up on the Internet, it becomes real easy to get sucked into an unhealthy feedback loop of bad takes.\nIf you're a fucking loser like I was in high school, you probably don't have a lot to boast or show off. Fashion isn't really something some teens (especially those dealing with poverty) care about, and you can't even get academic clout because you're just above average and not top of class. That's a lot of kids, and for a lot of kids, the way they stand out -- the way they feel a sense of belonging with a larger group -- is by seeing smug videos with politics contrary to what they hear around them and following suit.\nIt's opening YouTube in 2015 to watch Ben Shapiro own stupid latte-drinking college students.\n\n    \n    \nTeens' favorite form of self-validation can often be contrarianism.\nI can't stress enough how widespread these corny ass liberal owning videos were (and, honestly still are) back in 2014-2017. \nWhile before I had been around more conservative, white cultures due to where elementary and middle school were located, as well as church, high school was different. If you live in an urban, fairly liberal, black neighborhood and region like I did post middle school, it's really easy to look at the left-leaning beliefs of everyone around you -- parents, teachers, friends -- and respond in turn with \"counter-culture\" beliefs about how everyone around you is bluepilled.\n\nThey don't know that transgenderism is a lie! \n\n\nThey think racism is real... and yet all they talk about is race!\n\nSimple, logical conclusions you can reach from watching too much Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro, pretty mild neoconservative types that got a stranglehold on 2010s YouTube. It's not a coherent ideology, it's just pointing and laughing at people that are framed as silly dishonestly.\nEventually, though, I started to get curious: What exactly ARE these people's beliefs?\nWhat became a matter of sitting down and watching hours of SJW owned compilations turned into looking at conservative subreddits. Looking at Discord while it was in its early days. Just saying shit and being validated by my own friend group which had no real coherent beliefs either but thought the things I was saying were cool.\nFeeling out of place in high school, still dealing with puberty, depression, and (in retrospect) gender dysphoria, I found a new thing to be known by. I was the kid that raised their hand in class to debate the teacher. Started out as simple things like fervently arguing against rent control despite never having paid any or worked a job in my life, but eventually, I got dragged into arguing for IQ differences in races. \nScrolling through old /pol/ threads, learning about IQ tier lists where Ashkenazi Jews and Anglos were at top and my own, disgusting, mangy race were at the bottom, sitting in edgelord DMs where I built up tolerance for walls of slurs, and eventually starting and obsessively engaging with threads myself. 4chan, 8chan, Reddit, Discord, YouTube comments sections, I was everywhere.\nAnd it was so fucking EASY to just happen. When you're convinced you know the truth, and when every white bald charlatan with a mic is calling you red-pilled, you don't even question it. That's why I don't understand the surprise and bewilderment at a lot of kids getting swept up into the alt-right. I'm not defending the kind of person I was, I was a dumb 9th and 10th grader with zero work experience or meaningful real-world socialization. But you can see that it's not unreasonable.\nTeens' brains are developing and not set in stone.\nThe main thing that had me turn around was just engaging with the world around me more. As a black person, I'm already accustomed to code-switching around different people -- I'm not using tons of AAVE around white coworkers, but it's a different story with the niggas on my block. Expand that to having to present myself as an innocuous liberal when it came to extracurricular outings or interviews or whatever, and I realized how much more comfortable and genuine I was that way. \nI have to admit late 2010s BreadTube was the biggest factor in me turning around. Not a huge fan of how insufferably white they can be, but seeing that same niche, yet engaging media presence on the Internet drew me away from the dredges of Chud City. Broke off a lot of friendships and left a lot of Discord servers, but nowadays I'm able to rest easy knowing I consider race realism some bullshit and actually seek to improve the state of the world rather than hold it stagnant. \nI'm not telling ANYONE to engage with dumb, edgy teens. I get that different types of people have different levels of tolerance for that shit. But what I AM advocating for are creating healthier, more interesting communities for kids to feel \"weird\" and contrarian in. Don't let them act like me.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/pipeline/","title":"Beware of the pipeline"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/righttorepair/":{"body":"We live in a world where ownership of technology seems to be stripped away every day. It's not just being able to crack open your laptop and replace the storage, it's as bad as physical games being in their sunset period due to a bunch of technical and profit-driven reasons. It's really bad if you happen to be someone that is concerned with what they do and do NOT own in this current age. I don't like this trend and think for the most part it's anti-consumer.\nHowever, it's important to understand that digital ownership and repairability are not something most consumers actually care about.\nAnd I get it. The reason most consumers do not care whether or not their MacBook has SODIMM slots for replaceable memory and an M.2 slot for storage is because that's not something anyone does on a device they've spent more than a grand on. \nPeople use their computers as a tool for an end. People will buy obtuse, difficult to buy cars because they offer the features and value they're looking for, and their work computer is no different.\nIt's not even necessarily people that aren't technically inclined. It needs to be made incredibly apparent that in a world where time is money, nobody wants to waste it on a computer. It makes a lot more sense to hand it over to a professional and have Genius Bar or the equivalent for the vendor they bought their computer from to figure it out. \nMobile hardware (laptops, phones, and tablets) have all become less modular, less repairable, and frustratingly, more functional. They're packed in smaller form factors with proprietary arrangements of components that might as well be a black box to normal consumers. Gone are the days of easily being able to pop off the back of your phone's battery and slip in another -- replacing screens and battery can mean removing the waterproof seal off your phone and navigating through tiny, hard to track cables and pieces. In a world where no one outside of a small minority is repairing computers, and where hardware vendors have realized this fact and capitalized on it, what's the best way to discourage waste and create a somewhat sustainable ecosystem for consumers? \nRobust recycling programs are what the industry SHOULD be pointing towards. Unfortunately, as much as Apple, Lenovo, Dell, and others pride themselves on being eco-friendly, they're all notorious for wasting tons and tons of damaged hardware. This needs to be something strong-armed by the government -- sustainability is just too important.\nFramework offers incredibly modular laptops at a premium, and it's cool that there's hardware out there that you can repair just like your modest Japanese car. Some people really, really want to be able to own and understand everything about the tools they need all day, and it's understandable. \nRepairable devices can be treated like an extension of your body -- you can have a well-oiled machine just like a a healthy body.\nThe problem is Framework's offerings make no sense to most people. Repairability is cool, but who cares about that when it ships with a pretty standard IPS panel, loud fans, weak battery life, little to no vertical integration in the same vein as a Dell XPS or MacBook, and a bunch of other caveats? It's a cool novelty, but not something that actually makes sense for your average consumer.\n\n    \n    \n\nOld ThinkPads are in the same camp here. This isn't coming from a hater, most of my history with laptops consists of Reddit golden child ThinkPads from yesteryear, fitted with RAM and screen upgrades, Wi-Fi chip replacements, and everything in between.\nThe T430 is widely loved because despite its bulky build, almost everything on the device can be repaired or replaced.*\nLet's take a look:\n\nSocketed CPU\nTwo DDR3 DIMM slots\nEasy to access SATA port\nMSATA port in the back\nCan support a classic 7-row keyboard\nCan support a 1080p display mod\nMASSIVE 92Wh battery upgrade, plus very rare slice battery for another 100 or so\n\nYou can get a pretty solid laptop from 2013 to maybe... 2018 if you upgrade everything here. It's a heavy, massive brick that thermal throttles, doesn't support modern video codecs like VP9 or AV1 (have fun on YouTube and most of the modern web), and subpar 6 hour or less battery life even with that massive ass battery. It's incredibly fucking cool how it reaches PC-level upgradeability, but genuinely who cares? I have literally owned one and got through my first year of college with an upgraded T430 like this, so I'm speaking from experience.\nThere's no HDMI, no USB-C/Thunderbolt, only two USB 3 ports, mini-DP and VGA. It's packed with a ton of obsolete ports.\n\n    \n    \n\nOkay, but what about something more modern? A T480, perhaps?\nThe T480 actually isn't too bad of an older laptop. I've used one for a decent amount of time and it's currently a daily driver while I wait to get a newer MacBook for myself. Let's look at its upgradability:\n\nTwo DDR4 slots\nSATA slot with M.2 adapter\nWWAN M.2 slot that can fit another SSD\nLow-power 1080p, 1440p and 4k display upgrades\nDual-pipe heatsink mod for better cooling on Nvidia-less models\nBig 72Wh external battery to be paired with the internal 24Wh one\n\nIt's got two Thunderbolt 3 ports, solid build quality, and everything seems pretty appealing. You get a more pragmatic configurable laptop, and it might be a great daily driver for your Linux distro of choice or a Windows install. \nSo what's the problem? The severe thermal throttling (see a pattern?). Intel laptops have gotten worse and worse about this. The fans ramp up almost immediately if you even charge the damn thing, not to mention doing any kind of mildly intensive work. Aggressive undervolts are needed to not have an unbearably loud, hot computer.\nThe T480 style of more fresh, modern repairability seems incredibly awesome, but it's a real challenge to have an experience on par with what consumers expect nowadays.\nModern ThinkPads are often fitted with much more efficient Ryzen CPUs, and sip away at power quietly in comparison. While Lenovo's build quality has fallen off, they're still generally a better investment if you're the average consumer that values certain things more than being able to hypothetically upgrade their laptop.\nThe approach that works better for most consumers is buying all the hardware they need AT purchase and sticking with that machine until it gets old. It works for phones, and so laptops are literally no different in this regard. \nApple Silicon is the ultimate spit in the face to the entire hobbyist repairable laptop space.\n\n    \n    \n\nIt's incredibly frustrating knowing the reality is hyper-efficient, proprietary SoCs blow the entire laptop industry out of the water and have made everything else look silly. When you can squeeze 18-20 hours of battery life off current-gen offerings from Apple, when the integrated, unified, and impossible to replace memory and storage offer performance benefits, you start to realize that the tradeoff of it becoming a complete black box for consumers just does not matter. \nIt's not even that these kinds of proprietary components have to be entirely locked down -- Apple could easily introduce an ecosystem of proprietary modular components. They just don't care, and they KNOW their audience doesn't either. It's a smug \"fuck you\" that would only come from this company being on top for once after shipping garbage laptops from like 2016 all the way to 2019.\nApple will try to skirt around their general locked-down nature with half-assed programs like their self-service repair shit, but at the end of the day they know their customers are NOT opening up their computers. And honestly, neither am I.\nPraying for a world where we can strike a better balance between convenience, repairability, and environmental sustainability.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/righttorepair/","title":"Ownership, technology, and convenience -- highlighting the issue through laptops"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/scottpilgrimtakesoff/":{"body":"I recently finished the recent Rebuild of Eva-type sequel series Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. I think I enjoyed my time with the first few episodes, but there seems to be a general fundamental lack of understanding of what made the original comics work.\nThe series revolves around Scott and does not work when he is not there\nI've seen people on Twitter smugly insist on Scott \"being there\" because the anime constantly references stuff he did and his presence there, or argue that the original comic exists. Neither of these takes make sense, though. The core of this franchise is Scott Pilgrim and his own personal growth. It's about the way he's able to reconcile with himself and work through his issues with Ramona.\nScott doesn't face any consequences for his mistakes\nIf y'all thought the movie let this kid off the hook, this is arguably worse. Most of the Bad Shit this guy does is brushed off and not even taken seriously. \nKnives is able to bounce back and is largely fine and able to get over her lingering feelings incredibly quickly and conveniently at a point where Scott returns without having to worry much about the conflict, and they spell out loud How Bad Dating a High Schooler Was, Who Knew. \nCompare this to the comic where Scott and Knives relapse, after she insists the guy is toxic and unhealthy for her but that she's still trying to get over her feelings, and after kissing there's just nothing but mutual disgust.\nHe has to live with and carry that weight, and it can't just be forgotten as a footnote in his larger life.\nSame thing with Envy... he just never resolves anything with her and she's portrayed as strangely bitchy throughout the story, showing up to Scott's \"funeral\" just to sing a snarky song. The thing about Envy is Scott exaggerates how bad she is in his head and she's not on the same level as Ramona's evil exes.\nCrack fic energy\n\"What if\" scenarios aren't inherently bad. I think they can work if there's a clear focus and direction behind their writing. However, there's a certain point in the anime where the execution of the premise goes over a threshold and just becomes silly.\nI don't think all of Ramona's ex-es needed several episodes of fleshing out as realized characters. I'm not inherently against it, but I feel like with the increased focused on those characters, time that could be better spent exploring the core cast outside of Scott is lost.\nIt's also jarring to have every single one of them sort out their problems and become completely rehabilitated people. I can't help but feel it's a bit idealistic to have them all sort out their issues in that way.\nThe implication from the comic has always been that Ramona is somewhat reasonable in having a pattern of running away from her relationships, as not all of them have been great experiences. I just don't feel as if personally walking up to every single one of your shitty ex-boyfriends and talking things out is really a good idea.\nIt works with Scott as most of the people he's dated have lives outside of him and aren't really that much worse people than him. With Lisa, nothing ever actually kicked off, with Kim, they're still pretty good friends, and with Envy, he's able to get over his resentment. It doesn't work the same way when Ramona has assholes like Gideon in her past.\nI think Roxie was actually handled pretty well and enjoyed the way she was written, but that didn't warrant everybody else getting the same treatment.\nThe romance does not work\nOne of the reasons Ramona and Scott's relationship was so compelling to me when I read the story years back was the fact that they were by no means some couple fated to just bond together and they (especially Scott) needed to put actual effort into the relationship for it to sustain itself. They work through each others' issues together.\nTakes Off decides to just place Ramona in a space where she's able to have a self-contained character arc without Scott helping her confront her issues. It misses how Scott challenges Ramona on her insistence to hide from her problems and run away, but clearly he just didn't need to exist at all?\nBy the end of the story, we're greeted with a Scott Pilgrim that doesn't actually go on a thorough journey of personal growth, and just naturally decides to be less of an asshole despite not actually learning anything. He doesn't reconcile things with Envy, Lisa, or Kim.\nRamona wants to save a guy she knew for like two days, not because he did anything particularly significant, but because they're just cosmologically fated to be together in this timeline. It's undeserved and I'm confused at how such a fundamental misunderstanding of what the comics have to say about healthy relationships is pushed here, even unintentionally.\nI mean, shit, he doesn't even know her age by the end.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/scottpilgrimtakesoff/","title":"Why Scott Pilgrim Takes Off doesn't work"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/shortergames/":{"body":"\nThe triple-A game industry has gotten to the point of being absurdly, unsustainably bloated. Here are some of the reasons why, in my opinion, Shorter Games may actually be the right creative direction for the industry to take as a whole.\nDevelopment cycles can reach 5-7 years at this point, meaning any large, sprawling project can be an enormous risk.\nWhile some developers make use of that big ass time window (see Baldur's Gate 3), in reality this means a lot more Starfields. When you're taking enormous risks in terms of financing and development huge games, and publishers have to meet certain quotas, there's less and less room for video games that target limited audiences. \nBut... longer time means more quality!\nIn ideal circumstances, holy shit this is absolutely true. I'm not fundamentally against long development cycles and giving a project plenty of time to brew if it's actually used properly, but for every passion project from an indie studio there's false promises.\nThe longer a game takes to release, the more \"out of touch\" it is with the current state of development.\nPlenty of games releasing in 2023 are rocking old engines or technology, but outside of old tech, this can be as simple as a game with political commentary shipping out dated or having dialogue that belongs in 2018. My point is, the longer a game takes to ship out, and the longer it stays insulated as a project stewing, the more it ages. This means it's a lot harder to push the envelope of innovation.\nTo be fair, at the same time, constant innovation and pushing new engines and graphics technologies generally makes games harder to run and less accessible for a portion of gamers.\nIt needs to be made incredibly clear that many, MANY studios nowadays are struggling.\nA large amount of studios burn money like a teenage girl at the mall, between marketing, salaries, and a ton of other expenses.\nWhen you're barely above the red, ANYTHING will help you continue going. Even if your game developed in the last 5 years is not ready, shipping SOMETHING out during that time means money's brought in. We live in an era where software and game patches can be done incredibly efficiently and quickly. When severely over-scoped video games need funding to stay in the green, what better way to get funds to feed your developers than to drop a shoddy release and scrape together funds from the poor souls willing to buy it?\nCyberpunk's a great example of a game forced to crumble under the weight of a studio aiming for an incredibly large scale project, and not delivering at launch. Nowadays, with the Phantom Liberty DLC, it's viewed by most as a very solid RPG, but it took them a damn long time to reach that point. I'm all for innovation and pushing boundaries, but the scale in which so many games release is plain unsustainable and incredibly difficult to do in this current climate.\nWhat about the \"worse graphics\" part?\nI don't agree with it at all and think this point is silly. Video games should look good and push the envelope of what's possible visually. I do think there are plenty of bland-looking hyper-realistic games out nowadays, but there's nothing inherently wrong with realism and there's plenty of degrees of separation between indie pixel art or cel-shaded game and the latest nice-looking UE5 game.\nYou all knew this, but what matters more in a video game is solid art direction. Cohesive visual design tied with graphical advancements create incredible products, and it's a lot easier to do BOTH when your game is smaller in scale. It's also generally easier to optimize a game with less assets and moving parts to worry about.\nEasily accessible upscaling tech exists and is more and more prevalent\nPC gamers have been given the ability to use Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution for a little while now, offering algorithms to run intensive games at lower resolutions scaled up to their display's. This opens the door for a lot of taxing games to run on older hardware. The Steam Deck is a great example of a device that can use FSR to run powerful games. Even the struggling tablet hardware on the Nintendo Switch takes advantage of FSR to run games like Tears of the Kingdom at acceptable performance.\nThe industry will not correct itself, unless gamers decide to change\nLong development cycles and expansive, sprawling video games may become the new norm, but they are absolutely NOT something that we can adjust to. Notice how the PS5 is about 5 years old and is just now seeing any semblance of games designed specifically to run on it. Plenty of PS4 games just never really finished development as its younger sibling came out, and most consoles ultimately have a lifespan of about 7 years. \nSo, what can we do?\nOff the bat, support indie developers. They kinda just do their own thing and it seems to work pretty well. There's a lot of quality content coming out of that sphere, but these guys also need to put food on the table. \nConsumer activism is generally not a very effective strategy, unfortunately. I think that as a whole, the industry and its development trends will see a dramatic shift as gamers begin to get tired of open world formulas in video games. Ideally, they'd become an ambitious exception, rather than the norm that everyone defaults to.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/shortergames/","title":"I want shorter games with worse graphics"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/steamdeck/":{"body":"The Steam Deck is Valve's newest piece of tech, built on a long history of open source technology.\nWINE is a long-running project with the goal of translating Windows' Win32 API calls into something that Linux and macOS can run. It's not emulation -- think about Firefox and Chrome. Chrome is what most of the web is designed for, but Firefox is its own implementation that can also browse the web.\nHere's a video from Glorious Eggroll, a contributor to Linux gaming: https://youtu.be/K9khdYpMI5s\nLinux machines nowadays are able to also translated DirectX graphics calls to Vulkan or OpenGL, the former giving really, really solid performance and sometimes being outright more stable than the game running on Windows. Tons of money being thrown at these projects by Valve alongside a robust, passionate community have allowed the Steam Deck to exist -- a handheld laptop-like PC that works with some of the best Linux tech out right now.\nI wanna go more into this, but I wanted to kind of explain the use case for this device and what to expect through my own personal experience, being a PC gamer, a console gamer, and a Linux gamer for quite a while.\nThe Deck is pretty big. You're not carrying this comfortably in your pocket. It's the kind of thing you slip in a bag and play during your lunch break, not something you can pop out on a packed bus. \nBuild quality is very good. The touchpads are very responsive, the sticks and buttons feel just as good as modern dedicated controllers, and the speakers are actually incredible considering the form factor.\nThe main issue I have is the screen -- I understand that the 1280x800 screen is so low res to cut down on cost and allow the device to actually run games comfortably -- but the brightness is so damn low it makes playing outdoors very unappealing. Not a fan of that at all.\nThe carrying case fucking sucks. Buy a new one. I'm serious. It barely fits in my bag because of how bulky and thick it is, a stark contrast from the slim form factor of the actual device. I bought a Tomtoc case today and will keep y'all updated in terms of how much easier it is to fit in a bag. Out of the box, however, the carrying case eats up so much space carrying it around in a small to medium-sized bag is incredibly unappealing. If you're a student and have to lug around books and binders and a laptop all day, you'll be really pressed for space and have to figure out how to properly lay everything out so it fits. It's like playing Tetris sometimes except you really have to put the damn thing away quickly sometimes and it takes too much time.\nThere's no USB-C port on the bottom, only the top. This makes pretty much every dock kind of weird and awkward, as you still have to plug the device in from the top. Not nearly as seamless as a Switch or even a ROG Ally (outside of the Ally being an overpriced buggy piece of shit you shouldn't buy).\nIn terms of software, I've been mostly pleased, but there's a clear lack of polish in some areas. The experience docking and connecting to an external monitor is a mess, and the speakers are actually incredible considering the form factor. The default desktop mode with KDE Plasma is pretty functional, with most apps people would actually use available as Flatpaks. You really don't need a writeable root for most Desktop Linux systems.\nOne of the things I found atrocious was actually turning on the device and registering it with my Steam account. For some reason, it refused to install properly when connected to my Wi-Fi at home, without any indication of what was going on. A re-image didn't help; I had to literally pull out a USB-C dock and connect it directly via Ethernet. Past that initial roadblock, which would have led most people to straight-up refund the Deck, my experience was pretty good. The power management settings are really nice and granular. I even have undervolt scripts that I'm able to run for better thermals and power efficiency. Love it.\nSome games don't play nice, and that's kind of the draw of PC gaming. When you're not connected to the Internet, and you're using a platform where tons of games have malicious DRM that demands an online connection when gaming, it becomes a huge problem. Pretty much anything with Denuvo will require you to start it once while connected to the Internet, and if you decide to twerak the game with different Proton runtimes or maybe even mess around with mods, you could get locked out of your game for a day or so. This is unacceptable; an issue even with stationary gaming PCs is exacerbated when you don't really always have a stable connection out of the house. \nIf you expect the occasional quirk, check to see whether the games you buy work out of the box, and try to start your games at least once at home before leaving the house to avoid Denuvo bullshit, you'll have a good experience. Valve made a great piece of hardware and the community has help build a solid, yet flawed gaming experience through software.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/steamdeck/","title":"My thoughts on the Steam Deck"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/videogamesarentart/":{"body":"But, they could be.\nIf you're like me, you've probably seen plenty of Twitter accounts online insisting that Games Are Art and need to be taken seriously as such. Normally, this includes very mainstream, uncontroversially heralded video games that are considered classics. That's fine, I guess. \nBut that's as far as I've seen Gamers take this concept.\nGamers want to engage solely with the positive, reaffirming aspects of games. They're either puzzles to solve or feel good experiences that let them escape the long day at work. I get it.\nBut video games as a medium have become nothing but toys. I'm not saying toys are inherently bad. There are games where the entire appeal is its combat, or a fun gameplay loop. What I am saying is that there doesn't seem to be much of a serious vested interest in games making significant artistic statements. \nRemember the widespread reaction to Death Stranding? Rather than \"I want to see Kojima improve\" it was \"Kojima is a hack\", \"Where's my METAL GEAR\", etc. The problem is we've become incredibly stagnant and afraid of new artistic statements, chasing after the old and comfortable. \nCopying soul\nThere are a fuckton of indie games out nowadays that (respectably) try and buck the trend. My issue with the bulk of those I've experienced is they constantly find themselves pulling from other games as influence rather than other art forms. It's an insulated cycle. Signalis is a great example of this. I think it's an okay game, but it's stuck within the trappings of Silent Hill 2 and some of its other influences like Resident Evil that I felt it lacked its own identity. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is another game where I picked it up, enjoyed it, and realized that it was just Jet Set Radio Future at home. Not a bad game at all, but it's also not something that's making much of its own artistic statements.\nSo, what's the solution? Well, look at Silent Hill 2 as an example again. That game pulls heavily from David Lynch's discography, from Lost Highway to Blue Velvet. Akira Yamaoka was bumping Nine Inch Nails, Portishead, Metallica, and tons of other shit. Silent Hill 2 coalesced as a fusion of these creative influences, as well as the original game as a framework to build off. \nSince AAA games as a whole seem to care less and less about delivering anything but a positive toy-like experience, I think it's up to these talented, passionate indie developers to really kick things off and just do what games do best: become an art form that ties many others together. \nClunkiness, jankiness, and repetition\nI'm not saying video games should necessarily all feel like scraping your balls against sandpaper, but I really do think that game design as a whole is almost scared to make characters fee l physically limited in movement or introduce friction and frustration in the way things are approached. From Software sort of does this by making their games generally pretty difficult and having a high difficulty curve, but as a whole I see more focus on seamless, smooth movement, mechanics, etc.\nPersona 3 Reload\nPersona 3 Reload is currently in development as a ground-up Unreal remake of the original RenderWare PS2 title. Outside of my opinions on this game specifically being remade, or remakes in general as a concept, it's a fact that this is something coming out in the near future. One of the things that REALLY puts me off about this game is the \"rollback\" mechanic introduced in the menu, that allows the player to undo mistakes they've made throughout the story.\nIn typical Atlus fan fashion, any kind of frustration with this mechanic was instantly shut down by most people. I can understand really liking the direction of the remake and not understanding why others don't feel the same, but the issue here is that Persona 3 is fundamentally a game about the brevity of life on earth and making use of your time.\n\nTime never waits. It delivers all equally to the same end. You, who wish to safeguard the future, however limited it may be... You will be given one year; go forth without falter, with your heart as your guide...\n\nMechanically, the experience of the original is centered around making connections and Giving A Shit about the world around you. Time never waits, and you're running out of time, so make the best use of it. That's not to say lose your mind and panic over it, but... use your heart as your guide. Live life, and make sure when it's over you don't have too many regrets. A big aspect of this is permanence in the choices you make and your time management -- you can't just roll back time, you can only adapt and move forward.\nI get that Persona 3 has a load function built in, but I feel like that's just something you expect out of JRPGs. I don't particularly love that you can load saves from anywhere within the menu, but whatever. There's still a difference between a load function where the intent is clearly not to constantly roll back your choices and a ROLLBACK function within the menu. It highlights a difference in priorities and a focus on immediate convenience and avoiding \"clunk\" over making narrative statements through mechanics.\nDrakengard\nDrakengard 1 and 3 are Taro's casual shirt and sweats projects in comparison to the work clothes, business casual Nier Replicant and Automata. They're irreverent, disgusting, and parodic. They revel in repetition as a narrative device, because Taro looooves to hammer home the idea that killing and violence are unpleasant, and so is going through and experiencing a violent video game. This thematic statement can be perceived by just OPENING the original Drakengard and hearing the orchestral sample loops designed to drive the player insane. It's a Dionysian experience that desensitizes you to the way we transfigure horrific acts of murder into toys. \nDrakengards are repetitive, like most things in its genre, and have Something To Say. You don't have to like them, at all, but it's one of the most popular examples I can think of of aggressive frictive elements in video games, mechanics and design that is explicitly designed at points to frustrate and upset the player. \nI don't need every game to be a Drakengard 3, but the frustration and negative emotions it delivers should be examined as a whole and explored more within games.\nVideo games ARE art, but we don't treat them as such.\nI love games. I think a lot of people don't take them seriously. But I also refuse to retweet your dumb animation\"games are cinema pass it on\" posts about The Last of Us or some other movie game being Sophisticated and distancing themselves from the medium. I don't want to call games art after a large chunk of people don't give the slightest shit about game preservation and think anything older than 2010 demands a remake that \"fixes\" it. If games are art, they should be engaged with as such -- and we should try and connect with their artists and what they're trying to say.\nM.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/videogamesarentart/","title":"Video games aren't art"},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/yakuza5/":{"body":"Yakuza 5 is a fairly polarizing game in SEGA's long running crime drama series -- as an entry juxtaposed between two shorter experiences (4 and 6) and notorious for its huge runtime and expansive, thorough side content and five protagonists. To a lot of people, it's endemic of a lot of the issues with the franchise, but I think even a lot of its fans are underselling 5 as an experience and as a narrative.\n\n    \n    \n\nFive is a game focused entirely on one's aspirations -- what sacrifices are worth making for one, and how does one inherit them?\nOne of the most effective ways the game explores its own themes is by giving each protagonist bar Akiyama their own side story with its own self-contained narrative. 5 takes advantage of the format of Yakuza side content in its weird temporal space that can take place at any point in the story in order to further characterize its cast.\nKiryu's side content explores themes that Gaiden and 6 would later touch on: the struggle Kiryu as a character faces as the world shifts around him and his identity being forced under alongside it. Through racing, the usual substory wackiness and Kiryu's complete serious investment shines through, showing that even when he's unable to proudly present himself as a legend his strength and passion for everything he does still shines through. If you don't go through most of Kiryu's side content, you won't experience Nakajima's backstory: his regrets and willingness to rehab broken souls around him in Nagasugai with his taxi business. By the end of Kiryu's arc, we understand that Kiryu is far beyond the point of being able to hide from being a yakuza: and the dragon on his back exists as a perpetual reminder that Taichi Suzuki cannot stay. People are willing to support him and back him up, and the kindness that he vicariously and confidently expresses has an impact on everyone around him.\nSaejima's arc is a continuation of what began in Yakuza 4: a rough around the edges convict wracked with guilt and unrequited dreams of being a school teacher. Saejima's forced to relive the hell of prison again, but now with a level of maturity that wasn't present initially in the beginning of the previous game. This allows him to pour into Baba, in the same way he did Kido. The hunting minigame allows the guy to slow down and appreciate the world around him, and very importantly forces him to come to terms with the weight of taking and appreciating life. It's no coincidence that Saejima of all of the protagonists is the one shooting down deers and rabbits and not Kiryu. Later on, Okudera, the seasoned village hunter, is revealed as a man with blood on his hands not too different from Saejima. Only through self-acceptance and growth as a person is Okudera able to come to terms with his past actions and guilt, adopting the name of his own mentor, but also leave an impact on Saejima. It thoroughly parallels our protagonists's own life and story and also foreshadows Baba's own self-hatred and growth throughout the narrative.\nHaruka's explores the brutality of the idol industry in the 2010s, and how uncomfortable and monotonous the experience can be. While some parts of the job can be fun, and she gives it her absolute best, it's all under the pressure of losing funding to Morning Glory and being separated from her uncle. Haruka puts up with so much weird bullshit to the point where her strength is undeniably in powering through it all. \n\n    \n    \n\nNotice how the director goes to masturbate to the recording immediately afterwards??\n5's messaging with Haruka can be a little dodgy at points, but the amount of uncomfortable and creepy segments make it undeniably critique. \nMirei Park is a somewhat disliked character in this franchise, and while I can understand not liking her as a person, she's a very solidly written character that represents the challenges of the industry: hardened and worn down from years of being forced into a box.\nHer dream of becoming an idol stems from wanting to be validated and loved as a person, after not having much of a childhood or loving family to fall back on. Stripping herself of her own Korean heritage and aspirations for leading a happy married life with husband and child placed her in a position where she wishes to give other girls direction and live through her dream through them.\nPark understands the challenges of associating with yakuza, being the ex-wife of Goro Majima, and plays an enormous role in separating Haruka from Kiryu, fully aware that her career cannot meaningfully take off with association to the Dragon of Dojima. \nI think the curt, cold mindset she has perfectly explores the themes of the game and helps elaborate them in a more nuanced way. Haruka, past a certain point, is conciously powering through as an idol for the sake of Park rather than herself. This is the reason she finishes her song at Dream Line rather than not showing up. And it helps justify the blood, sweat, and tears she put into all of the bullshit side content. \nMy personal headcanon is Haruka viewed Park as a mother figure to a certain degree. She quite literally spent more time with her in that one outing they shared together than she ever did with Yumi in Yakuza 1. Through it all, I think it's clear that Haruka cherishes their bond and views her as family. \nAkiyama exists in this game. He has the least justification for being there and doesn't even really have his own side content, but piggybacks off Haruka and does what he does best: helping her live out her own dream. This idea was explored in Yakuza 4 and we can see him putting it to practice.\nLastly, Shinada ties everything together in a really solid bow. I think he's one of the most competently written characters in the franchise. \n\n    \n    \n\nThis single scene sold me on the character. Shinada is an everyman in the same vein as Ichiban of later games: an everyman down on his luck that fits every definition of \"washed up\". Shinada is obsessed with achieving his past glory as a rookie in the MLB, hitting an incredible home run and immediately having his career squashed by a ban. \nSince then, he runs away from his problems, sleeps off hunger, and is so deep in debt it's beyond parody. \n\nShinada's acceptance and growth as a person comes from killing his past and moving on from his dream, accepting the circumstances surrounding his famous home run being fabricated. Through his batting side content, he knows for sure his own talents, and rather than be bogged down in uncertainty and failed promises, he's able to stand on his own two feet.\nWhat makes Shinada so powerful is his willingness to help both Baba and Haruka achieve something special in their lives despite having no direct involvement with either of them. He's just able to Give Enough of a Shit by the end of Yakuza 5 that he can help others achieve the same rush and the same joy he did hitting that homer all those years back.\nYakuza 5 is not telling you to pursue your dreams no matter what. That's a harmful message when presented with no nuance, and this series is a little smarter than that. Instead, Yakuza 5 wants you to ask WHY you're pursuing a dream and to never sacrifice the love of those around you for it. \nEverything ties together as the dying Omi chairman Kurosawa is revealed to tie the fates of everyone together: he simply wants the old guard of yakuza dead so his own son can inherit it all, passing down his dream to someone else. It's the kind of detached, insane goal that only a dying old man could want, and Aizawa is forced to carry it all on his shoulders at the end.\nI think a lot of people miss that 5 is fully and entirely aware of how jarring Aizawa is as a final boss. He openly hates the idea of inheriting some bullshit dream from someone else, and instead wants to take things into his own hands and achieve things through his own physical strength. A wounded Kiryu is the one big obstacle to him getting there, and he couldn't care less about what his old man thinks.\nNotice the koi tattoo on his back.\n\n    \n    \n\nLike Shishido in Gaiden, the difference between Aizawa and Kiryu is one has wants, needs, and desires outside of himself and the yakuza life: Kiryu has a family to get back to. Aizawa's hunger still can't overpower a guy who just wants to see his kid safe and happy, and Kiryu leaves him with encouraging words to push him to achieve more. Aizawa's dream unfortunately came close to the dissolution of the Tojo and Omi as a whole, but his desire for strength is still admirable and aspirational. \nI hope you can see why I think 5 is a well thought-out story. Its scale allows it to explore a theme through the eyes of multiple protagonists in a way that a lot of the series just can't. The rich side content, grandiose main story, over the top combat and soundtrack, and emotional core make it the most \"Yakuza\" Yakuza game.\n","id":"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/yakuza5/","title":"Why I love Yakuza 5"}},"docInfo":{"https://zandyne.xyz/":{"body":3,"title":0},"https://zandyne.xyz/about/":{"body":29,"title":0},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/":{"body":2,"title":2},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/blackculture/":{"body":219,"title":4},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/cyberbullying/":{"body":245,"title":3},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/fossapps/":{"body":448,"title":3},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/linuxdesktop/":{"body":938,"title":3},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/linuxdisplays/":{"body":298,"title":6},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/macos/":{"body":862,"title":2},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/pipeline/":{"body":582,"title":2},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/righttorepair/":{"body":765,"title":7},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/scottpilgrimtakesoff/":{"body":448,"title":5},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/shortergames/":{"body":549,"title":5},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/steamdeck/":{"body":506,"title":3},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/videogamesarentart/":{"body":670,"title":4},"https://zandyne.xyz/blog/yakuza5/":{"body":843,"title":3}},"length":16},"lang":"English"};
