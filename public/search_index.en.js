I think it does a lot right, but holy shit a full-time job really makes it hard to play Suda51 games, with all their tedium and narrative density. \nIt kinda dawned on me why Kill the Past never really blew up like other long-running VN series, like Zero Escape, Danganronpa, Ace Attorney, and Science Adventure: it's just way too dense and disconnected from what mainstream VN readers want. And I think that's a shame. Kill the Past is one of the most thematically focused and socially conscious VN series, and feels diverse and cultured in a way these others lack. It's pulling from arthouse films, American blockbusters, and even constantly building on itself narratively. TSC morphs into FSR morphs into 25W. I think the very intentional thematic progression works better than the MCU/comic style \"whoa look it's this glup shitto from this other franchise\" thing that Science Adventure does, as an example.\nThere's no romance routes, no H-scenes, unconventional presentation with grating typewriter sounds going on in the background, The Silver Case and its sequel are fundamentally a different beast from the galge formula that even some of my favorite visual novels happen to follow.\nI think a lot of VN readers just need that initial nudge that allows them to branch out.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/25thward/","title":"The 25th Ward - The Silver Case: Suda's Glorious Mess"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/blackculture/":{"body":"I'm black.\nThis is pretty damn obvious if you did a cursory look at any of my social media, this website, whatever. But yeah, I'm black. And I'm slowly coming around to accepting that.\nYou see, as a kid, I was raised in pretty white areas at school that weren't overtly and obviously racist, but more subtly and uncomfortably bigoted at points. The occasional comment about how my nose is too big, my skin is too dark to look nice, how \"people like me don't speak English\", it goes on and on. Whatever. My point is, not the best kind of environment for a black boy in America.\nI was homeschooled for a year in my life and became incredibly unashamed at expressing my thoughts and being generally friendly to the people around me. When I got looked at like I was crazy after re-entering real school (because homeschooled kids lack social cues most of the time), I quickly wanted nothing more than to fit in with the other kids.\nThings got so bad when I was really young that my self-image was that of a white kid. Tried to get my name legally changed to whatever corny ass white names I could think of at the time, and grew angry at my hair not following the same pattern as the kids around me. I wanted to fit in, but obviously that didn't really work out.\nNow, I've lived a pretty comfortable lower-middle class life. Parents are together and have a healthy relationship, sisters both have their quirks but enjoy my presence, and I've got about 6 certificates, a nice-looking resumé, and a couple credits working towards my bachelor's. But I think this was my downfall, at the same time. You see, I lacked the upbringing of even a lot of my Black peers in high school. They had to worry about whether or not the water would be running at home, I was concerned with dumb shit like my Gentoo installation at home breaking. And this kinda pulled me into the alt-right later on in life.\n...More on that later.\nAnyway, something clicked towards the end of high school, going into college, where I realized that a lot of my dysphoric feelings were because of:\nA. the fact that the gender binary didn't really work for me.\nB. I'm black, and not white.\nSo my twenties are gonna be a needed reclaiming of my own culture. That's probably the reason behind my excessive use of nigga :)\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/blackculture/","title":"My disconnect from Black culture -- and how I reclaimed it"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cyberbullying/":{"body":"Nothing I'm saying here should be controversial.\nI'm just baffled at how a lot of people have bought into the idea that cyberbullying is a simple thing people can just block out.\nYou need to understand that people cannot just ditch their social life online, especially if they obtain validation from it. Just like it's hard to break off a friend group that might treat you like shit in real life, because you don't really have any other options, it's also really hard to break away from a community you've joined and become comfortable with on Discord or something.\nWhen you have some friends that you're totally cool with in the same space as their friends that make you want to die, you're kinda limited in options. You could maybe form a space without the people that make you uncomfortable, but that's a great way to start drama. \nMaybe you start a group DM, but then someone decides to leak screenshots of you talking shit about the people you don't like. Maybe it's moving to a different platform altogether -- from Discord to Telegram or Twitter circles or some shit. I don't know, my point is it's not always very easy to just up and move and place yourself in a comfortable space where you STILL have some level of online socialization.\nAnd, no, I'm not saying that online communities are a replacement for offline frined groups. What I am saying is that a lot of people have a real desire for both, and feeling somewhat comfortable in both spaces is crucial to mental health. Disregarding this because online interactions \"aren't real\" or something is a really limited view of the situation. Platforms like Discord allow for some level of anonymity, letting a lot of people comfortably interact with friends around them without feeling like they need to present a certain way. Voice training doesn't matter on Discord unless you open voice chat, and no one's going to judge whether you \"pass\" or not.\nWhen people are blamed for taking drastic actions -- like self-harm or worse -- from cyberbullying, it's not something we should downplay as being as simple as \"turn off the computer\". Honestly, a lot of the time, that makes things worse as an entire angle of socialization may now have disappeared for someone.\nIf you go to a Christian school or a heavily Christian workplace and come home to Christian family or friends, knowing damn well that they wouldn't approve of you being gay, what space do you have but the Discord server you have with friends that lets you shoot the shit and say what's on your mind? Would you really give up that space because one or two people push your buttons?\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cyberbullying/","title":"Cyberbullying sucks, actually"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/fossapps/":{"body":"Too much modern software is designed to fuck you in the ass.\nAnd so many people put up with it. This isn't me looking down on people from my ivory tower, I'm forced to use some of it too. BUT there's a way out sometimes.\nFree and open-source software is software where you can see all of the ingredients all laid out for you -- the code is easily accessible and available to anyone and instead of it being exclusive to a big company, it's something anyone can contribute to. The best open source projects are massive collaborative efforts like the Linux kernel, Android, a large chunk of the modern web, etc. \nAnd desktop apps are no different. Turns out there's a lot of alternatives to paywall-ridden, subscription-based software that barely works and nags you about expiring trial periods. \nI'm going to just name applications I actually like that I make use of, and divide them by groups.\nVideo editing\nUnfortuantely, I haven't been able to completely abandon commercial video editors. I need to use DaVinci Resolve for large, potentially collaborative projects (still a great editor, btw). Outside of that, I've been able to move any fun personal projects and the vast majority of my video editing to open source alternatives.\nOlive is an up and coming editor that's pretty smooth and performant, but is still in active development and is currently technically an alpha release. Despite this, I've happily done tons of stuff with this editor, including complex keyframed visuals. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to just have a smooth, modern editor.\nKdenlive and the technologies and frameworks that it's made out of have been around for a while. If you like Sony Vegas-like UI, it might be the right option for you. The issue with Kdenlive is it lags behind in terms of GPU acceleration, so if you have a beefy GPU, that shit's going to be almost completely dormant using this. Pretty solid tried and true option.\nDrawing and painting\nGIMP has quite a learning curve and pales in comparison in terms of functionality to Photoshop, but I've done a ton of image editing and visuals with it. \nKrita is a great painting software that has nice, intuitive UI. Haven't found anything that quite matches what it can do in terms of functionality. \nInkscape is a vector image editing tool, and while it has a bit of a learning curve too, I've found it to be just as powerful as the alternatives like Adobe Illustrator. I really like this one.\nWeb browsers\nIn my personal opinion, there's very little reason to actively use a browser that isn't open-source. If you're like me, you're inputting a ton of personal information into these things, and personally I'd rather have something I use so extensively vetted by a community, with its vulnerabilities and functionality laid bare. \nYou don't have to look far:\nFirefox has been around for a while, and it's also been really fucking fast for a while. Uses less RAM than Chrome and friends, and is a little more respectful to your privacy. There's also a lot of customization you can do to the way it looks, if that's your thing.\nThe thing about most modern web browsers is they share an engine with Chrome, the Blink engine. It's kind of concerning how the entire modern web just revolves around this one technology and if some vulnerability appears, everything suffers. Electron apps like Discord, Slack, and Spotify that are running in mini web-browsers also use Blink. \nFirefox stands as the one big non-Chrome browser you can use nowadays, so outside of just having a lot of practical benefits you can feel good inside knowing you're fighting against Google's monopoly or something. I dunno, probably won't do much. Fuck Google.\nHowever, if you really want to use a Chromium-based browser, I recommend Brave. It's got the kitchen sink with it out of the box: adblocking, a BitTorrent client, and weird crypto shit that you can disable, thankfully. \nKDE Connect\nIf you have an Android and a Windows or Linux computer, you're probably missing out on one of the most useful tools I've run into recently: KDE Connect. Being able to view battery life, get notifs on my PCs, reply to SMS messages from my PC, ring my phone, control music playback, and share files seamlessly has made my life a lot easier. You can get a Mac &amp; iPhone-like integration without buying overpriced metal slabs :)\nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it kinda drives me insane seeing people settle for crappy commercial software when sometimes there are perfectly good alternatives they could switch to with way less issues. Give some of them a look.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/fossapps/","title":"FOSS apps you should be using"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/gamesidontlike/":{"body":"I have been known for not being the biggest fan of Umineko When They Cry.\nA lot of VN culture's strongest soldiers, especially in the West, consider Umineko to be doujin author Ryukishi07's magnum opus. Coming from a shoestring budget and blowing up after the widespread success of Higurashi, this guy sat down and decided to completely revolutionize the mystery genre (or something). \nUmineko is a bold and self-confident exploration of the way we engage with fiction and how we use it to address our own traumas, but I believe it does this irresponsibly.\nI think what would help y'all understand where I'm coming from is to \"get\" my taste in media. \nThis is the kind of shit that gets me excited.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\nThere's an undercurrent of anti-escapism and making the best out of a traumatic life or experiences. This relates to my own personal experiences, being mistreated physically and also falling prey really fucking often to depression and self-esteem challenges.\nSo, Umineko seems to fit me like a glove at first glance. What's the issue? Didn't I relate to Ange's own personal struggles and want to vicariously experience the same growth she did?\nNo, and I think Ryukishi07 makes a careless and honestly very frustrating mistake when writing the Answer arcs of Umineko: it frames escapism as not just an indulgent short-term decision to stay sane, but a tool worth using long-term to avoid coming to terms with reality.\nThis is what separates it even from Wonderful Everyday, a visual novel that consistently insinuates that our own perspectives are limited and restricted and reality is arguably malleable: Subahibi is insistent on you choosing to confront and embrace reality, while Umineko wants you to outright side with \"magic\", falsehoods and easy comforts in order to cope.\nIt's not as simple as killing your past, either, it's the opposite -- choosing to believe in a past that never actually happened for your own comfort.\nI'm fine with flawed or imperfect characters in media, and I'd argue that I have a higher tolerance than most when it comes to forgiving and looking past their mistakes. I'm a huge advocate of rehabilitation and second chances. However, something about bashing your own family members' skulls in pleasure is irredeemable to me. Kyrie kinda just puts the entire experience of Umineko in a bad light to me -- why is Ange being encouraged to cherish her in any form? Same applies for Kinzo; this guy raped his own daughter and yet Ryukishi portrays him as a Silly Funny Guy in Episode 8 without ever considering how this could be fucked up. \nUmineko struggles with treating heinous actions as such, but instead ignores them past a certain point and looks at you strange for feeling thrown off.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/gamesidontlike/","title":"Truth and Escapism: Explaining my issues with Umineko"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/linuxdisplays/":{"body":"My Linux history has a long association with Nvidia. Not out of choice, but just because at the time I didn't really know Nvidia had some issues on the platform. I needed a low profile GPU for the low end OEM PC I owned at the time, and popping in a GT 1030 seemed like the right choice. At the time, I was daily driving Windows anyway, and never had to even think about whether or not my displays would work, hardware acceleration would work, etc.\nSwitched to Linux, and on the surface things seemed to be smooth, but then the issues hit. Keep in mind this was around 2018-2019.\n\nHardware acceleration didn't work, PERIOD. Outside of mpv/VLC.\nThat specific card doesn't support NVENC, which isn't necessarily an Nvidia driver problem, but it's frustrating how they ship out cards without such a useful feature.\nKernel updates would frequently break shit. Some days I'd be greeted with a black screen, or Plymouth would be squashed or replaced with an ugly fallback visual.\nVKD3D (DirectX12 to Vulkan translation layer) experiences MAJOR peformance hits on Pascal or older cards. Also not technically something Nvidia can do anything about, but still a headache.\nMultiple displays with different refresh rates, VRR, and fractional scaling never worked.\nThe desktop in general was noticeably choppier than Windows.\n\nI've also had headaches with Nvidia Optimus on older Thinkpads. Jesus Christ, I never want to return to that again. \nAll of these pain points, some of which self-imposed for using old hardware, have permanently burned me and made me reluctant to use Nvidia on Linux hardware. Despite this, I still use a low profile Quadro in my NAS/media server. Nvidia's nice for that use case, since they offer very power efficient cards with solid encoders. Even then, I'm considering whether or not I should just replace that thing with a Radeon.\nAMD GPUs have a mountain of issues, like their lack of focus on compute and non-gaming workloads, but almost every issue I run into on AMD I've found workarounds for. I use DaVinci Resolve and it works fine on AMD nowadays with OpenCL, OBS streaming and recording works fine, and whenever I get bored and decide to work with Stable Diffusion that also works fine. I'm not moving away from their offerings anytime soon, and I just hope they take some of their issues more seriously.\nI bought a 6600 XT months ago and it's been an almost seamless experience. The only problems with the GPU are actual documented problems with the specific model I have, like not working in the PCIe x16 slot properly without lowering it in BIOS to x8 speeds, and the occasional crash in two specific games (Judgment and Lost Judgment). I also have a Steam Deck which has given me an issue-free gaming experience on the same GPU architecture (RDNA2). Life is good.\nThere's nuance to the GPU conundrum on Linux, and I'm not trying to present AMD as the no-brainer option in all cases, but I cannot emphasize enough how it works so much better for me.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/linuxdisplays/","title":"Linux display headaches - Why I'm stuck on Wayland"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/macos/":{"body":"So I've recently ended up using a lot of Macs due to work. Not just MacBooks, but iMacs. They range from current gen M1s and M2s to ancient 2012 MacBooks. \nAnd... I have to say, I quite like the experience.\nDon't get me wrong, in terms of usability and functionality, I think Linux is leagues ahead. But GOD this is a way more usable experience than Windows, to the point where I'm seriously considering giving it a shot as a dual boot via GPU passthrough on my Linux PC.\nI'll get into my issues with Windows later, but right now, I just want to highlight a lot of the things I like about Macs, on both the hardware and software front.\nHardware\nMacs all have a nice aluminum finish to them that makes them feel very premium and high-profile. The metal finish doesn't inspire confidence that I'd be able to drop it from a flight of stairs though, but that's most laptops that aren't old ThinkPads or rugged military laptops. \nThe keyboards nowadays are quite good. They're, again, not as good as a ThinkPad keyboard, and lack the incredibly useful trackpoint, but there are so many other advantages that it doesn't really matter to me. I personally prefer keyboards with a bit more travel, but at minimum it's a huge improvement from the weird feel and travel of the older Intel MacBooks in that weird phase.\nApple Silicon is a really hard truth to accept, as someone that cares quite a bit about repairability and openness in hardware. There's no real way to upgrade storage or RAM on Apple Silicon SoCs. This means once your M1 Mac becomes old and obsolete, there's not much you can do if you didn't spend the premium on more RAM and storage. The trade off, of course, is improved speed, but I'm not sure if it's a worthy sacrifice.\nThe battery life and performance is absolutely absurd on these machines nowadays, so while it feels disgusting and sinful to me, the usability of these laptops ramps up incredibly well. At home, I have a bulky full ATX tower eating up space and making noise in my room. It's not the loudest thing ever. It's got a Noctua air cooler and Arctic PST PWM cast fans (which are a bit annoying). But, M1/M2 Macs are silent. I can go to bed and not hear a single thing, and that's nice. They can fit into a smaller form factor and be passively cooled, which makes me dream of the day I can rest a mini-sized PC on my desk with performance on par with my current gaming PC.\nSoftware\nI think there are some things that are incredibly well thought-out about macOS. One of the things I actually really love is the difference in approach to keyboard shortcuts. On Windows and Linux, you have to memorize a bunch of unintuitive keyboard shortcuts revolving around the Super/Meta/Windows key. They're not consistent or intuitive, in my opinion. The other day, in fact, I was working on a Windows machine when it prompted me to input CTRL+ALT+Delete in order to change the soon-to-expire password as per organization group policy. Kinda had to take a step back and realize \"what the hell?\"\nOne of the things I love is how reliable the ⌘C and ⌘V shortcuts are on Mac. Makes copy-pasting into terminals a dream, since you no longer have to awkwardly hit Shift+Ctrl+C or Shift+Ctrl+V to interact with content on the terminal. It's the little things that count.\nmacOS has had large chunks of its filesystem read-only since Catalina, and that's also a really good choice, in my opinion. I'm a huge fan of immutable operating systems and think they offer benefits to stability and possibly even security. Apple issues out image-based updates in the same vein as iOS, Android, Chrome OS, and most immutable Linux distros, and I think this is the right call rather than the clunky experience that Windows and mutable Linux distros offer a lot of the time.\n\n    \n    \n\nThere's no reason this should ever happen.\nSoftware installation (that's not done through the App Store itself) is as dead simple as dragging and dropping an application folder to the /Applications folder. Most installers will prompt you for this automatically. It's really straightforward and is a punch above the garbage .MSI installers on Windows. Unfortunately, not having a well-integrated first-party package manager sucks and makes installing a lot of software not as seamless as Linux.\nBrew works fine until you realize a huge chunk of software needs to be compiled. It's kind of like FreeBSD ports or the AUR where a lot of stuff is available but it all needs to be compiled. Updates and installation can take forever. \nBut most large, mainstream desktop apps are a simple as mounting a .DMG file and dragging/dropping.\nThe window management is quite good in some areas, but lacking in others. The virtual desktop management is really solid, with a focus on neatly organizing full-screen apps. A three-finger swipe up on the trackpad gives me easy access to all of my desktops and windows, and a swipe to the left or right seamlessly switches them. Ctrl + arrow keys has the same behavior.\nUnfortunately, the window tiling features are so behind everything else it's pathetic. It's such a pain getting windows to tile properly, as you have to press and hold the maximize button to even do it. I don't understand why this feature is so hard to access and why it's so limited. You can install extensions to make this experience a little better, but it's really embarrassing how insulated Apple can be at times.\nMusic production and any audio stuff has been incredibly solid on a Mac. I don't really have any complaints, but I've found that I rarely run into compatibility issues with audio on any of the three operating systems I use for it. My MIDI controllers like my drum pad and keyboard work fine, but they work fine on everything. \nVideo editing has been fine, too. The experience is better than Linux in that regard as DaVinci Resolve is more stable and performant on AMD there. I've used it on my Hackintosh VM without any issues.\nAnother big thing is how gorgeous the entire operating system looks. There's a level of visual consistency that's just completely absent of Windows, and that Linux is only just now working towards. One of my biggest issues with Windows in general is how ugly and incoherent everything looks as a whole. Every application does its own thing, and even built-in stuff can range from Windows 3.1 to XP to 10 to 11 in terms of UI style. It really irks me.\nThe lack of any kind of gaming support is kind of preventing me from even considering trying this thing full-time. I do 100% of my gaming on Linux nowadays, between my PCs and my Steam Deck. I just game on the host system nowadays and it works fine, though.\nWhat's my beef with Windows, and why have I somewhat come around to Apple recently?\nWindows, to me, represents the stuffy, old Oxford button-down shirt approach to desktop use. It's not necessarily more efficient, it's just familiar, and so bogged down in its familiarity that it brings everything else down with it. So many Linux distros aim to emulate Windows and all of its frustrating quirks, and they have a lot of the same usability issues as a result. There's an insane focus on backwards compatibility and clinging to the old and familiar, and a lot of Windows use in general seems skewed towards old design conventions and legacy software. It feels old, and not in a good and comfy way. \nIt's far from being unusable, especially with Windows Subsystem for Linux and the wide berth of software support. Don't get me wrong. I just really, really dislike using it nowadays. It feels unpolished. macOS, for better or worse, makes a lot of choices that distinguish it from Windows, and it's not as much of a Swiss-army knife as Windows is as a result. It's not your best option for video games, or CAD software, or a long list of other use cases. \nApple sucks\nI don't love or even like Apple as a company. They provide proprietary, walled-garden products and entrap you in their ecosystem, without offering the flexibility that one might want integrating their products with non-Apple stuff. Good luck having solid integration between a Mac and an Android, or an iPhone and Linux. \nThey charge extravagant prices for their hardware and have a spotty track record that's only now kind of bouncing back to where it was.\nDespite this, I think macOS has become a pretty usable product for personal desktop use. If you need some specific legacy software, sure, go ahead and use Windows. If you need Samba shares, USE WINDOWS, PLEASE. If you need a more integrated development environment, or if you don't want to lose out on flexibility, feel free to use desktop Linux. But honestly, for the most part, this shit \"just works.\"\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/macos/","title":"Why I kinda like Macs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/pipeline/":{"body":"Teenagers like validation.\nYou don't need me to tell you this. Pretty much any kid from the age of like 13 all the way to... honestly, their early 20s can be absolutely obsessed with social validation. Puberty hits and kids are funneled into conformity at schools that demand they set aside a block of their day towards the same shit over and over again. \nWhen kids are thrown into school, they simultaneously want to fit in and stand out.\nIf they're forced to whip out an iron every day and throw on a stuffy uniform, they'll wear shoes that slightly push the limits of the dress code. Fuck it, I might be forced to wear a polo and khakis every day but I'm still gonna throw on my Yeezys. At the same time, if someone talks shit about them, they might just show up with a different pair of sneakers just to feel acknowledged.\nThis is just a normal part of being a teenager. \nSame thing applies to politics at that age.\nThe vast majority of middle-class teens in America aren't really endowed with years of experience working and engaging with the real world. When there are really no consequences to strong opinions you pick up on the Internet, it becomes real easy to get sucked into an unhealthy feedback loop of bad takes.\nIf you're a fucking loser like I was in high school, you probably don't have a lot to boast or show off. Fashion isn't really something some teens (especially those dealing with poverty) care about, and you can't even get academic clout because you're just above average and not top of class. That's a lot of kids, and for a lot of kids, the way they stand out -- the way they feel a sense of belonging with a larger group -- is by seeing smug videos with politics contrary to what they hear around them and following suit.\nIt's opening YouTube in 2015 to watch Ben Shapiro own stupid latte-drinking college students.\n\n    \n    \nTeens' favorite form of self-validation can often be contrarianism.\nI can't stress enough how widespread these corny ass liberal owning videos were (and, honestly still are) back in 2014-2017. \nWhile before I had been around more conservative, white cultures due to where elementary and middle school were located, as well as church, high school was different. If you live in an urban, fairly liberal, black neighborhood and region like I did post middle school, it's really easy to look at the left-leaning beliefs of everyone around you -- parents, teachers, friends -- and respond in turn with \"counter-culture\" beliefs about how everyone around you is bluepilled.\n\nThey don't know that transgenderism is a lie! \n\n\nThey think racism is real... and yet all they talk about is race!\n\nSimple, logical conclusions you can reach from watching too much Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro, pretty mild neoconservative types that got a stranglehold on 2010s YouTube. It's not a coherent ideology, it's just pointing and laughing at people that are framed as silly dishonestly.\nEventually, though, I started to get curious: What exactly ARE these people's beliefs?\nWhat became a matter of sitting down and watching hours of SJW owned compilations turned into looking at conservative subreddits. Looking at Discord while it was in its early days. Just saying shit and being validated by my own friend group which had no real coherent beliefs either but thought the things I was saying were cool.\nFeeling out of place in high school, still dealing with puberty, depression, and (in retrospect) gender dysphoria, I found a new thing to be known by. I was the kid that raised their hand in class to debate the teacher. Started out as simple things like fervently arguing against rent control despite never having paid any or worked a job in my life, but eventually, I got dragged into arguing for IQ differences in races. \nScrolling through old /pol/ threads, learning about IQ tier lists where Ashkenazi Jews and Anglos were at top and my own, disgusting, mangy race were at the bottom, sitting in edgelord DMs where I built up tolerance for walls of slurs, and eventually starting and obsessively engaging with threads myself. 4chan, 8chan, Reddit, Discord, YouTube comments sections, I was everywhere.\nAnd it was so fucking EASY to just happen. When you're convinced you know the truth, and when every white bald charlatan with a mic is calling you red-pilled, you don't even question it. That's why I don't understand the surprise and bewilderment at a lot of kids getting swept up into the alt-right. I'm not defending the kind of person I was, I was a dumb 9th and 10th grader with zero work experience or meaningful real-world socialization. But you can see that it's not unreasonable.\nTeens' brains are developing and not set in stone.\nThe main thing that had me turn around was just engaging with the world around me more. As a black person, I'm already accustomed to code-switching around different people -- I'm not using tons of AAVE around white coworkers, but it's a different story with the niggas on my block. Expand that to having to present myself as an innocuous liberal when it came to extracurricular outings or interviews or whatever, and I realized how much more comfortable and genuine I was that way. \nI have to admit late 2010s BreadTube was the biggest factor in me turning around. Not a huge fan of how insufferably white they can be, but seeing that same niche, yet engaging media presence on the Internet drew me away from the dredges of Chud City. Broke off a lot of friendships and left a lot of Discord servers, but nowadays I'm able to rest easy knowing I consider race realism some bullshit and actually seek to improve the state of the world rather than hold it stagnant. \nI'm not telling ANYONE to engage with dumb, edgy teens. I get that different types of people have different levels of tolerance for that shit. But what I AM advocating for are creating healthier, more interesting communities for kids to feel \"weird\" and contrarian in. Don't let them act like me.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/pipeline/","title":"Beware of the pipeline"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/steamdeck/":{"body":"The Steam Deck is Valve's newest piece of tech, built on a long history of open source technology.\nWINE is a long-running project with the goal of translating Windows' Win32 API calls into something that Linux and macOS can run. It's not emulation -- think about Firefox and Chrome. Chrome is what most of the web is designed for, but Firefox is its own implementation that can also browse the web.\nHere's a video from Glorious Eggroll, a contributor to Linux gaming: https://youtu.be/K9khdYpMI5s\nLinux machines nowadays are able to also translated DirectX graphics calls to Vulkan or OpenGL, the former giving really, really solid performance and sometimes being outright more stable than the game running on Windows. Tons of money being thrown at these projects by Valve alongside a robust, passionate community have allowed the Steam Deck to exist -- a handheld laptop-like PC that works with some of the best Linux tech out right now.\nI wanna go more into this, but I wanted to kind of explain the use case for this device and what to expect through my own personal experience, being a PC gamer, a console gamer, and a Linux gamer for quite a while.\nThe Deck is pretty big. You're not carrying this comfortably in your pocket. It's the kind of thing you slip in a bag and play during your lunch break, not something you can pop out on a packed bus. \nBuild quality is very good. The touchpads are very responsive, the sticks and buttons feel just as good as modern dedicated controllers, and the speakers are actually incredible considering the form factor.\nThe main issue I have is the screen -- I understand that the 1280x800 screen is so low res to cut down on cost and allow the device to actually run games comfortably -- but the brightness is so damn low it makes playing outdoors very unappealing. Not a fan of that at all.\nThe carrying case fucking sucks. Buy a new one. I'm serious. It barely fits in my bag because of how bulky and thick it is, a stark contrast from the slim form factor of the actual device. I bought a Tomtoc case today and will keep y'all updated in terms of how much easier it is to fit in a bag. Out of the box, however, the carrying case eats up so much space carrying it around in a small to medium-sized bag is incredibly unappealing. If you're a student and have to lug around books and binders and a laptop all day, you'll be really pressed for space and have to figure out how to properly lay everything out so it fits. It's like playing Tetris sometimes except you really have to put the damn thing away quickly sometimes and it takes too much time.\nThere's no USB-C port on the bottom, only the top. This makes pretty much every dock kind of weird and awkward, as you still have to plug the device in from the top. Not nearly as seamless as a Switch or even a ROG Ally (outside of the Ally being an overpriced buggy piece of shit you shouldn't buy).\nIn terms of software, I've been mostly pleased, but there's a clear lack of polish in some areas. The experience docking and connecting to an external monitor is a mess, and the speakers are actually incredible considering the form factor. The default desktop mode with KDE Plasma is pretty functional, with most apps people would actually use available as Flatpaks. You really don't need a writeable root for most Desktop Linux systems.\nOne of the things I found atrocious was actually turning on the device and registering it with my Steam account. For some reason, it refused to install properly when connected to my Wi-Fi at home, without any indication of what was going on. A re-image didn't help; I had to literally pull out a USB-C dock and connect it directly via Ethernet. Past that initial roadblock, which would have led most people to straight-up refund the Deck, my experience was pretty good. The power management settings are really nice and granular. I even have undervolt scripts that I'm able to run for better thermals and power efficiency. Love it.\nSome games don't play nice, and that's kind of the draw of PC gaming. When you're not connected to the Internet, and you're using a platform where tons of games have malicious DRM that demands an online connection when gaming, it becomes a huge problem. Pretty much anything with Denuvo will require you to start it once while connected to the Internet, and if you decide to twerak the game with different Proton runtimes or maybe even mess around with mods, you could get locked out of your game for a day or so. This is unacceptable; an issue even with stationary gaming PCs is exacerbated when you don't really always have a stable connection out of the house. \nIf you expect the occasional quirk, check to see whether the games you buy work out of the box, and try to start your games at least once at home before leaving the house to avoid Denuvo bullshit, you'll have a good experience. Valve made a great piece of hardware and the community has help build a solid, yet flawed gaming experience through software.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/steamdeck/","title":"My thoughts on the Steam Deck"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/videogamesarentart/":{"body":"But, they could be.\nIf you're like me, you've probably seen plenty of Twitter accounts online insisting that Games Are Art and need to be taken seriously as such. Normally, this includes very mainstream, uncontroversially heralded video games that are considered classics. That's fine, I guess. \nBut that's as far as I've seen Gamers take this concept.\nGamers want to engage solely with the positive, reaffirming aspects of games. They're either puzzles to solve or feel good experiences that let them escape the long day at work. I get it.\nBut video games as a medium have become nothing but toys. I'm not saying toys are inherently bad. There are games where the entire appeal is its combat, or a fun gameplay loop. What I am saying is that there doesn't seem to be much of a serious vested interest in games making significant artistic statements. \nRemember the widespread reaction to Death Stranding? Rather than \"I want to see Kojima improve\" it was \"Kojima is a hack\", \"Where's my METAL GEAR\", etc. The problem is we've become incredibly stagnant and afraid of new artistic statements, chasing after the old and comfortable. \nCopying soul\nThere are a fuckton of indie games out nowadays that (respectably) try and buck the trend. My issue with the bulk of those I've experienced is they constantly find themselves pulling from other games as influence rather than other art forms. It's an insulated cycle. Signalis is a great example of this. I think it's an okay game, but it's stuck within the trappings of Silent Hill 2 and some of its other influences like Resident Evil that I felt it lacked its own identity. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is another game where I picked it up, enjoyed it, and realized that it was just Jet Set Radio Future at home. Not a bad game at all, but it's also not something that's making much of its own artistic statements.\nSo, what's the solution? Well, look at Silent Hill 2 as an example again. That game pulls heavily from David Lynch's discography, from Lost Highway to Blue Velvet. Akira Yamaoka was bumping Nine Inch Nails, Portishead, Metallica, and tons of other shit. Silent Hill 2 coalesced as a fusion of these creative influences, as well as the original game as a framework to build off. \nSince AAA games as a whole seem to care less and less about delivering anything but a positive toy-like experience, I think it's up to these talented, passionate indie developers to really kick things off and just do what games do best: become an art form that ties many others together. \nClunkiness, jankiness, and repetition\nI'm not saying video games should necessarily all feel like scraping your balls against sandpaper, but I really do think that game design as a whole is almost scared to make characters fee l physically limited in movement or introduce friction and frustration in the way things are approached. From Software sort of does this by making their games generally pretty difficult and having a high difficulty curve, but as a whole I see more focus on seamless, smooth movement, mechanics, etc.\nPersona 3 Reload\nPersona 3 Reload is currently in development as a ground-up Unreal remake of the original RenderWare PS2 title. Outside of my opinions on this game specifically being remade, or remakes in general as a concept, it's a fact that this is something coming out in the near future. One of the things that REALLY puts me off about this game is the \"rollback\" mechanic introduced in the menu, that allows the player to undo mistakes they've made throughout the story.\nIn typical Atlus fan fashion, any kind of frustration with this mechanic was instantly shut down by most people. I can understand really liking the direction of the remake and not understanding why others don't feel the same, but the issue here is that Persona 3 is fundamentally a game about the brevity of life on earth and making use of your time.\n\nTime never waits. It delivers all equally to the same end. You, who wish to safeguard the future, however limited it may be... You will be given one year; go forth without falter, with your heart as your guide...\n\nMechanically, the experience of the original is centered around making connections and Giving A Shit about the world around you. Time never waits, and you're running out of time, so make the best use of it. That's not to say lose your mind and panic over it, but... use your heart as your guide. Live life, and make sure when it's over you don't have too many regrets. A big aspect of this is permanence in the choices you make and your time management -- you can't just roll back time, you can only adapt and move forward.\nI get that Persona 3 has a load function built in, but I feel like that's just something you expect out of JRPGs. I don't particularly love that you can load saves from anywhere within the menu, but whatever. There's still a difference between a load function where the intent is clearly not to constantly roll back your choices and a ROLLBACK function within the menu. It highlights a difference in priorities and a focus on immediate convenience and avoiding \"clunk\" over making narrative statements through mechanics.\nDrakengard\nDrakengard 1 and 3 are Taro's casual shirt and sweats projects in comparison to the work clothes, business casual Nier Replicant and Automata. They're irreverent, disgusting, and parodic. They revel in repetition as a narrative device, because Taro looooves to hammer home the idea that killing and violence are unpleasant, and so is going through and experiencing a violent video game. This thematic statement can be perceived by just OPENING the original Drakengard and hearing the orchestral sample loops designed to drive the player insane. It's a Dionysian experience that desensitizes you to the way we transfigure horrific acts of murder into toys. \nDrakengards are repetitive, like most things in its genre, and have Something To Say. You don't have to like them, at all, but it's one of the most popular examples I can think of of aggressive frictive elements in video games, mechanics and design that is explicitly designed at points to frustrate and upset the player. \nI don't need every game to be a Drakengard 3, but the frustration and negative emotions it delivers should be examined as a whole and explored more within games.\nVideo games ARE art, but we don't treat them as such.\nI love games. I think a lot of people don't take them seriously. But I also refuse to retweet your dumb animation\"games are cinema pass it on\" posts about The Last of Us or some other movie game being Sophisticated and distancing themselves from the medium. I don't want to call games art after a large chunk of people don't give the slightest shit about game preservation and think anything older than 2010 demands a remake that \"fixes\" it. If games are art, they should be engaged with as such -- and we should try and connect with their artists and what they're trying to say.\nM.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/videogamesarentart/","title":"Video games aren't art"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":3,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":30,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":2,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/25thward/":{"body":145,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/blackculture/":{"body":219,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/cyberbullying/":{"body":245,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/fossapps/":{"body":448,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/gamesidontlike/":{"body":249,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/linuxdisplays/":{"body":298,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/macos/":{"body":862,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/pipeline/":{"body":582,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/steamdeck/":{"body":506,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/videogamesarentart/":{"body":670,"title":4}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
